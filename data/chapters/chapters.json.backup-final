The sequence of nucleotides along a gene is transcribed \ninto mRNA, which is then translated into a linked series of \nprotein building blocks called amino acids. Once completed, \nthe amino acid chain forms a specific protein with a unique \nshape and function. The entire process by which the informa\n-\ntion in a gene directs the manufacture of a cellular ...\n\ntorage. The key is the ability of \nmany biological processes to self-regulate by a mechanism \ncalled feedback.\nIn feedback regulation, the output or product \nof a process regulates that very process. The most com\n-\nmon form of regulation in living systems is negative \n feedback, a loop in which the response reduces the ini-\ntial stimulus. As seen in the example of insulin signaling \n(Figure 1.10), after a meal the level of the sugar glucose \nin your blood rises, which stimulates cells of the pancreas \nto secrete insulin. Insulin, in turn, causes body cells to \ntake up glucose and liver cells to store it, thus decreas\n-\ning the blood glucose level. This eliminates the stimulus \nfor insulin secretion, shutting off the pathway. Thus, \nthe output of the process (insulin) negatively regulates \nthat process.\nThough less common than processes regulated by nega\n-\ntive feedback, there are also many biological processes regu-\nlated by positive feedback, in which an end product speeds up \nits own...\n\nthat invisible \nghosts are fooling with your desk lamp! Because science \nonly deals with natural, testable explanations for natu\n-\nral phenomena, it can neither support nor contradict \nthe invisible ghost hypothesis, nor whether spirits or \nelves cause storms, rainbows, or illnesses. Such super\n-\nnatural explanations are simply outside the bounds of \n science, as are religious matters, which are issues of per-\nsonal faith. Science and religion are not mutually exclu-\nsive or contradictory; they are simply concerned with \n different  issues.\nThe Flexibility of the Scientific Process\nThe way that researchers answer questions about the \n natural and physical world is often idealized as the \n scientific method. However, very few scientific inquiries \nadhere rigidly to the sequence of steps that are typically \nused to describe this approach. For example, a scientist \nmay start to design an experiment, but then backtrack \nafter realizing that more preliminary observations are \n necessary. In...\n\nut the book to walk through other examples of \nbiological inquiry.\nThe researchers built hundreds of models of mice and \nspray-painted them to resemble either beach or inland mice, \nBeach\npopulation\nFlorida\nInland\npopulation\nGULF OF \nMEXICO\nBeach mice live on sparsely vegetated sand dunes along the coast.

By generating ion gradients, ion \ntransport provides the potential energy that powers \nprocesses ranging from an organism’s regulation of \nsalts and gases in internal fluids to its perception of \nand locomotion through its environment.\nIn marine bony fishes, ion \ngr  adients drive secretion of salt \n(NaCl), a process es  sential to avoid \ndehydration. Within gills, the pumps, \ncotransporters, and channels of specialized chloride cells function \ntogether to drive salt from the blood across the gill epithelium and \ninto the surrounding salt water. (See Figure 44.3.)\nIon gr  adients provide the basis for the opening of  a plant stoma \nby surrounding guard cells. Active transport of  H\n+\n out of a guard \ncell generates a voltage (membrane potential) that drives inward \nmovement of  K\n+\n. This uptake of  K\n+\n b y guard cells triggers an \nosmotic influx of water that changes cell shape, bowing \nthe guard cells outward and thereby opening the stoma. (See \nConcept 36.4.)\nIn neurons, tr ansmission of information as nerve impulses is \nmade possible by the opening and closing of channels selective \nfor sodium or other ions. These signals enable nervous systems to \nreceive and process input and to direct appropriate output, such \nas this    leap of a frog capturing prey.

Formic acid (CH\n2\nO\n2\n) \nconsists of carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and \noxygen (O).\nThe number of protons (    ) determines\nan atom’s identity. Oxygen has 8 protons.\nAn atom’s electron (   ) distribution \ndetermines its ability to form bonds. \nOxygen has space for 2 more electrons,\nso it can form 2 bonds.\nIn formic acid, this O attracts H’s electron, releasing H\n+ \nand making this compound an acid, which stings.\nA compound’s properties depend on its \natoms and how they are bonded together.\n–\n–\n–\n–   –\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n+\n+\n+\nC\nH\nH\nO\nO\nC\nH\nH\nO\nO\nC\nH\nO\nO\nH\n+\n–\nFormic acid\nOxygen\natom\n...\n\nrgy that \nmatter possesses because of its location or structure. For exam\n-\nple, water in a reservoir on a hill has potential energy because \nof its altitude. When the gates of the reservoir’s dam are \nopened and the water runs downhill, the energy can be used \nto do work, such as moving the blades of turbines to generate \nelectricity. Because energy has been expended, the water has \nless energy at the bottom of the hill than it did in the reser\n-\nvoir. Matter has a natural tendency to move toward the lowest \npossible state of potential energy; in our example, the water \nruns downhill. To restore the potential energy of a reservoir, \nwork must be done to elevate the water against gravity.\nThe electrons of an atom have potential energy due to their \ndistance from the nucleus \n(Figure 2.6). The negatively charged \nelectrons are attracted to the positively charged nucleus. \nAtomic\nnucleus\nThird shell (highest energy \nlevel in this model)\nSecond shell (higher \nenergy level)\nFirst shell (lo...\n\nctron can move from one shell to another, but only by \nabsorbing or losing an amount of energy equal to the differ\n-\nence in potential energy between its position in the old shell \nand that in the new shell. When an electron absorbs energy, \nit moves to a shell farther out from the nucleus. For example, \nlight energy can excite an electron to a higher energy level. \n(Indeed, this is the first step taken when plants harness the \nenergy of sunlight for photosynthesis, the process that pro\n-\nduces food from carbon dioxide and water.) When an electron \nloses energy, it “falls back” to a shell closer to the nucleus, \nand the lost energy is usually released to the environment as \nvisible light or ultraviolet radiation.\nHydrogen\n1\nH\nHelium\n2\nHe\nAtomic number\nNeon\n10\nNe\nFluorine\n9\nF\nOxygen\n8\nO\nNitrogen\n7\nN\nCarbon\n6\nC\nBoron\n5\nB\nBeryllium\n4\nBe\nLithium\n3\nLi\nArgon\n18\nAr\nChlorine\n17\nCl\nSulfur\n16\nS\nPhosphorus\n15\nP\nSilicon\n14\nSi\nAluminum\n13\nAl\nMagnesium\n12\nMg\nSodium\n11\nNa\nFirst\nshell\nSecond\nshell\nThi...\n\nway, and then separate.\nSeveral types of weak chemical interactions are important \nin organisms.

Therefore, the specific heat of \nwater is 1 calorie per gram and per degree ...\n\nduring the summer. NASA scientists also found evidence \nof hydrated salts, indicating water is present.

When acids dissolve in \nwater, they donate additional \nH\n+\n to the solution. An acid is a \nsubstance that increases the hydrogen ion concentration of a \nsolution. For example, when hydrochloric acid (HCl) is added \nto water, hydrogen ions dissociate from chloride ions:\nHCl \nS\n H\n+\n + Cl\n-\nThis source of H\n+\n (dissociation of water is the other source) \nresults in an acidic solution—one having more \nH\n+\n than OH\n-\n.\nA substance that reduces the hydrogen ion concentration \nof a solution is called a base. Some bases reduce the \nH\n+\n con-\ncentration directly by accepting hydrogen ions. Ammonia \n(\nNH\n3\n), for instance...",

Years later, L-dopa (below, left), a chemical \nused to treat Parkinson’s disease, was given to some of these \npatients. L-dopa was remarkably effective at eliminating the \nparalysis, at least temporarily. However, its enantiomer, D-dopa \n(right), was subsequently shown to have no effect at all, as is the \ncase for Parkinson’s disease.

Glucose, fructose, and other sugars that have six carbons \nare called hexoses. Trioses (three-carbon sugars) and pentoses \n(five-carbon sugars) are also common.\nStill another source of diversity for simple sugars is in \nthe way their parts are arranged spatially around asym\n-\nmetric carbons. (Recall that an asymmetric carbon is a car-\nbon attached to four different atoms or groups of atoms.) \nGlucose and galactose, for example, differ only in the place-\nment of parts around one asymmetric carbon (see the purple \nboxes in Figure 5.3). What seems like a small difference is \nsignificant enough to give the two sugars distinctive shapes \nand binding activities, thus different behaviors.\nAlthough it is convenient to draw glucose with a linear car\n-\nbon skeleton, this representation is not completely accurate. \nIn aqueous solutions, glucose molecules, as well as most ...\n\nifferent disaccharide. \n(b)\nDehydration reaction in \nthe synthesis of sucrose. \nSucrose is a disaccharide \nformed from glucose and \nfructose.

The architecture \nand function of a polysaccharide are determined by its mono\n-\nsaccharides and by the positions of its glycosidic linkages.\nStorage Polysaccharides\nBoth plants and animals store sugars for later use in the form of \nstorage polysaccharides \n(Figure 5.6). Plants store starch, a poly-\nmer of glucose monomers, as...\n\nllulose \n(see Figure 5.7).\nSome microorganisms can digest cellulose, breaking it \ndown into glucose monomers. A cow harbors cellulose-\ndigesting prokaryotes and protists in its gut. These microbes \nhydrolyze the cellulose of hay and grass and convert the \nglucose to other compounds that nourish the cow. Similarly, \na termite, which is unable to digest cellulose by itself, has \nprokaryotes or protists living in its gut that can make a meal \nof wood. Some fungi can also digest cellulose in soil and \nelsewhere, thereby helping recycle chemical elements within \nEarth’s ecosystems.\nAnother important structural polysaccharide is chitin, \nthe carbohydrate used by arthropods (insects, spiders, crusta\n-\nceans, and related animals) to build their exoskeletons—hard \ncases that surround the soft parts of an animal \n(Figure 5.8). \nMade up of chitin embedded in a layer of proteins, the case is \nleathery and flexible at first, but becomes hardened when the \nproteins are chemically linked to each othe...\n\nnd folds, collectively referred to as secondary \nstructure, are the result of hydrogen bonds between the repeat-\ning constituents of the polypeptide backbone (not the amino acid \nside chains). Within the backbone, the oxygen atoms have a partial \nnegative charge, and the hydrogen atoms attached to the nitrogens \nhave a partial positive charge (see Figure 2.14); therefore, hydrogen \nbonds can form between these atoms. Individually, these hydrogen \nbonds are weak, but because they are repeated many times over a \nrelatively long region of the polypeptide chain, they can support a \nparticular shape for that part of the protein.\n    One such secondary structure is the c\n helix, a delicate coil held \ntogether by hydrogen bonding between every fourth amino acid, as \nshown above. Although each transthyretin polypeptide has only one\nc helix region (see the Primary and Tertiary Structure sections),                              \nother globular proteins have multiple stretches of c helix separated...\n\nain refolds so that its \n    Mastering Biology Interview with Linus \nPauling: Winner of the Nobel Prize in \nChemistry and the Nobel Peace Prize\nWhat Determines Protein Structure?\nYou’ve learned that a unique shape endows each protein with \na specific function. But what are the key factors determin-\ning protein structure?

A given gene along a DNA molecule can direct synthesis \nof a type of RNA called messenger RNA (mRNA). The mRNA mol-\necule interacts with the cell’s protein-synthesizing machinery \nto direct production of a polypeptide, which folds into all or \npart of a protein. We can summarize the flow of genetic infor\n-\nmation as DNA S RNA S protein (see Figure 5.22). The sites \nof protein synthesis are cellular structures called ribosomes. In \na eukaryotic cell, ribosomes are in the cytoplasm—the region \nbetween the nucleus and the cell’s outer boundary, the plasma \nmembrane—but DNA resides in the nucleus.

Moreover, \nthe thickness, molecular composition, and types of chemical \nreactions carried out in a given membrane are not fixed, but \nmay be modified several times during the membrane’s life. \nHaving already looked at the nuclear envelope, we will now \nfocus on the endoplasmic reticulum and the other endomem\n-\nbranes to which the endoplasmic reticulum gives rise.\nThe Endoplasmic Reticulum:  \nBiosynthetic Factory\nThe endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is such an extensive \nnetwork of membranes that it accounts for more than half \nthe total membrane in many eukaryotic cells. (The word \nendoplasmic means “within the cytoplasm,” and reticulum is \nLatin for “little net.”) The ER consists of a network of mem\n-\nbranous tubules and sacs called cisternae (from the Latin \ncisterna, a reservoir for a liquid). The ER membrane separates \nthe interna...\n\npatches transport vesicles and the products they contain. \nA Golgi stack has a structural and functional directionality, with a cis face \nthat receives vesicles containing ER products and a trans face that dispatches \nvesicles. The cisternal maturation model proposes that the Golgi cisternae \nthemselves “mature,” moving from the cis to the trans face while carrying \nsome proteins along. In addition, some vesicles recycle enzymes that had been \ncarried forward in moving cisternae, transporting them “backward” to a less \nmature region where their functions are needed.\nproducing a large variety of carbohydrates. Membrane phos-\npholipids may also be altered in the Golgi.\nIn addition to its finishing work, the Golgi apparatus also \nmanufactures some macromolecules.

In Chapter 43, \nthe introduction of the adaptive  immune response has been \nshifted to later in the chapter, allowing students to build on \nthe features of innate immunity before tackling the more \ndemanding topic of the adaptive response. In  Chapter 46,  a \nnew section of text in Concept 46.4 provides a clear and current \nintroduction to “Biological Sex, Gender Identity, and Sexual \nOrientation in Human Sexuality.” In Chapter 48, the structural \noverview of neurons is now completed before the introduction \nof information processing. A new illustration, \n Figure 49.8, \nprovides a concise visual comparison of sympathetic and \nparasympathetic neurons with each other and with motor \nneurons of the CNS. In addition, in-depth consideration of \nglia is now provided in Concept 49.1, where it is more logically \nintegrated into the overview of nervous systems. At the end of \nthe unit, an eye-catching photograph of the...\n\nan membrane \nproteins indicates that at least some membrane proteins move \nsideways within the plane of the plasma membrane.\nData from  L. D. Frye and M. Edidin, The rapid intermixing of cell surface antigens \nafter formation of mouse-human heterokaryons, Journal of Cell Science 7:319 (1970).\nWHAT IF? Suppose the proteins did not mix in the hybrid cell, even \nmany hours after fusion. Could you conclude that proteins don’t move \nwithin the membrane?

A protein built into \nthe membrane may be an enzyme with \nits active site (where the reactant binds) \nexposed to substances in the adjacent \nsolution. In some cases, several enzymes \nin a membrane are organized as a team \nthat carries out sequential steps of a \nmetabolic pathway.\nIntercellular joining. Membrane \nproteins of adjacent cells may hook \ntogether in various kinds of junctions, \nsuch as gap junctions or tight junctions  \n(see Figure 6.30). This type of binding \nis more long-lasting than that shown  \nin (d).\nCell-cell recognition. Some glyco-\nproteins serve as identification tags that \nare specifically recognized by membrane \nproteins of other cells. This type of \ncell-cell binding is usually short-lived \ncompared with that shown in (e). \nSignal transduction. A membrane          \nprotein (receptor) may have a binding \nsite with a specific shape that fits the \nshape of a chemical messenger, such as \na hormone. The external messenger \n(signaling mol...\n\nand the balance \nof water between the cell and its environment are crucial to \norganisms. Let’s now apply what we’ve learned about osmosis \nin this system to living cells.\nWater Balance of Cells Without Cell Walls\nTo explain the behavior of a cell in a solution, we must consider \nboth solute concentration and membrane permeability. Both \nfactors are taken into account in the concept of tonicity, the \nability of a surrounding solution to cause a cell to gain or lose \nwater. The tonicity of a solution depends in part on its concen\n-\ntration of solutes that cannot cross the membrane (nonpene-\ntrating solutes) relative to that inside the cell. If there is a higher \nconcentration of nonpenetrating solutes in the surrounding \nsolution, water will tend to leave the cell, and vice versa.\nIf a cell without a cell wall, such as an animal cell, is immersed \nin an environment that is isotonic to the cell (iso means “same”), \nthere will be no net movement of water across the plasma mem\n-\nbrane. Wat...\n\nof the membrane potential \non the ion’s movement). This combination of forces acting \non an ion is called the electrochemical gradient.\nIn the case of ions, then, we must refine our concept of pas\n-\nsive transport: An ion diffuses not simply down its concentration \ngradient but, more exactly, down its electrochemical gradient. \nFor example, the concentration of \nNa\n+\n inside a resting nerve \ncell is much lower than outside it. When the cell is stimulated, \ngated channels open that facilitate \nNa\n+\n diffusion. Sodium ions \nthen “fall” down their electrochemical gradient, driven by the \nconcentration gradient of \nNa\n+\n and by the attraction of these \ncations to the negative side (inside) of the membrane. In this \nexample, both electrical and chemical contributions to the \nelectrochemical gradient act in the same direction across the \nmembrane, but this is not always so. In cases where electrical \nforces due to the membrane potential oppose the simple diffu\n-\nsion of an ion down its conce...",

If the supply of ATP exceeds demand, then catabolism \nslows down as ATP molecules accumulate and bind to the same \nenzymes, inhibiting them. (You’ll see specific examples of this \ntype of regulation when you learn about cellular respiration \nin the next chapter; see, for example, Figure 9.19.) ATP, ADP, \nand other related molecules also affect key enzymes in anabolic \npathways. In this way, allosteric enzymes control the rates of \nimportant reactions in both sorts of metabolic pathways.\nIn another kind of allosteric activation, a substrate \nmolecule binding to one active site in a multisubunit enzyme \ntriggers a shape change in all the subunits, thereby increas\n-\ning catalytic activity at the other active sites \n(Figure 8.20b). \nAllosteric enzyme\nwith four subunits\nSubstrate\nActive formStabilized\nactive form\nInactive form\nInactive form\nStabilized \ninactive form\nStabilized active form\nRegulatory\nsite (one\nof four)\nActivator\nInhi...",

The ability of a pigment to absorb various wave-\nlengths of light can be measured with an instrument called a \nspectrophotometer. This machine directs beams of light of \ndifferent wavelengths through a solution of the pigment and \nmeasures the fraction of the light transmitted at each wave\n-\nlength. A graph plotting a pigment’s light absorption versus \nwavelength is called an absorption spectrum \n(Figure 10.8).\nThe absorption spectra of chloroplast pigments provide \nclues to the relative effectiveness of different wavelengths \nfor driving photosynthesis since light can perform work \nin chloroplasts only if it is absorbed....\n\nthe energy \nfrom light not only to boost one of their electrons to a higher \nenergy level, but also to transfer it to a different molecule—the \nprimary electron acceptor, which is a molecule capable of \naccepting electrons and becoming reduced.\nThe solar-powered transfer of an electron from the \nreaction-center chlorophyll a pair to the primary electron \nacceptor is the first step of the light reactions. As soon as the \nchlorophyll electron is excited to a higher energy level, the \nprimary electron acceptor captures it; this is a redox reaction. \nIn the flask shown in Figure 10.11b, isolated chlorophyll fluo\n-\nresces because there is no electron acceptor, so electrons of \nphotoexcited chlorophyll drop right back to the ground state. \nIn the structured environment of a chloroplast, however, \nan electron acceptor is readily available, and the potential \nenergy represented by the excited electron is not dissipated \nas light and heat.

You have probably encountered \nbiofilms many times, perhaps without realizing it. The slimy \ncoating on a fallen log or on leaves lying on a forest path, and \neven the film on your teeth each morning, are examples of \nbacterial biofilms. In fact, tooth-brushing and flossing disrupt \nbiofilms that would otherwise cause cavities and gum disease.\nAnother example of bacterial behavior coordinated by \nquorum sensing is the secretion of ...\n\nerland and his colleagues at \nVanderbilt University were investigating how the animal hor\n-\nmone epinephrine (also called adrenaline) triggers the “fight-\nor-flight” response in animals like the impala in Figure 11.1. \nOne effect of epinephrine is to mobilize fuel reserves, which \ncan be used by the animal to either defend itself (fight) or try \nto escape (flight). Epinephrine stimulates the breakdown of \nthe storage polysaccharide glycogen within liver cells and \nskeletal muscle cells. The breakdown of glycogen releases the \nsugar glucose 1-phosphate, which the cell converts to glucose \n6-phosphate. The liver or muscle cell can then use this com\n-\npound, an early intermediate in glycolysis, for energy pro-\nduction (see Figure 9.8). Alternatively, the compound can be \nstripped of phosphate and released from the liver cell into the \nblood as glucose, which can fuel cells throughout the body.\nBut how, exactly, does epinephrine mobilize glucose for \nuse?

But glycogen breakdown is only part of the \nfight-or-flight response that epinephrine brings about; the \noverall effect on the body includes an increase in heart rate and \nalertness, as well as a burst of energy. Given that caffeine blocks \nthe activity of cAMP phosphodiesterase, propose a mechanism \nby which caffeine ingestion leads to heightened alertness and \nsleeplessness.\n11. \nSCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, AND SOCIETY The aging \nprocess is thought to be initiated at the cellular level. Among \nthe changes that can occur after a certain number of cell \ndivisions is the loss of a cell’s ability to respond to growth \nfactors and other signals. Much research into aging is aimed \nat understanding such losses, with the ultimate goal of \nextending the human life span. Not everyone, however, \nagrees that this is a desirable goal. If life expectancy were \ngreatly increased, discuss what might be the social and \necological consequences.\n12. \nWRITE ABOUT A THEME: ORGANIZATION The properties \nof life emerge at the biological level of the cell. The highly \nregulated process of apoptosis is not simply the destruction of \na cell; it is also an emergent property. Write a short essay (about \n100–150 words) that briefly explains the role of apoptosis \nin the development and proper functioning of an animal, \nand describe how this form of programmed cell death is a \nprocess that emerges from the orderly integration of signaling \npathways.\n13. \nSYNTHESIZE YOUR KNOWLEDGE\nThere are five basic tastes—sour, salty, sweet, bitter, and \n“umami.” Salt is detected when the concentration of salt \noutside of a taste bud cell is higher than that inside of it, and \nion channels allow the passive leakage of \nNa\n+\n into the cell. \nThe resulting change in membrane potential (see Concept 7.4) \nsends the “salty” signal to the brain. Umami is a savory taste \ngenerated by glutamate (glutamic acid, found in monosodium \nglutamate, or MSG), which is used as a flavor enhancer in foods \nsuch as taco-flavored tortilla chips. The glutamate receptor is a \nGPCR, which, when bound, initiates a signaling pathway that \nends with a cellular response, perceived by you as “taste.” If \nyou eat a regular potato chip and then rinse your mouth, you \nwill no longer taste salt. But if you eat a flavored tortilla chip \nand then rinse, the taste persists. (Try it!) Propose a possible \nexplanation for this difference.\nFor selected answers, see Appendix A.\nTEST YOUR UNDERSTANDING\n  For more multiple-choice questions, go to the Practice Test in the \nMastering Biology eText or Study Area, or go to goo.gl/GruWRg.\nLevels 1-2: Remembering/Understanding",

The two centrosomes move apart during prophase \nand prometaphase of mitosis as spindle microtubules grow \nout from them. By the end of prometaphase, the two centro\n-\nsomes, one at each pole of the spindle, are at opposite ends of \nthe cell. An aster, a radial array of short microtubules, extends \nfrom each centrosome. The spindle includes the centrosomes, \nthe spindle microtubules, and the asters.\nEach of the two sister chromatids of a duplicated chromo\n-\nsome has a kinetochore, a structure made up of proteins that \nhave assembled on specific sections of DNA at each centro-\nmere. The chromosome’s two kinetochores face in opposite \ndirections. During prometaphase, some of the spindle micro-\ntubules attach to the kinetochores; these are called kinetochore \nmicrotubules. (The number of microtubules attached to a \nkinetochore varies among species, from one microtubule in \nyeast cells to 40 or so in some mammalian cel...\n\num Escherichia coli \nis about 500 times as long as the cell. For such a long chromo\n-\nsome to fit within the cell, it must be highly coiled and folded.\nIn some bacteria, the process of cell division is initiated \nwhen the DNA of the bacterial chromosome begins to repli\n-\ncate at a specific place on the chromosome called the origin \nof replication, producing two origins. As the chromosome \ncontinues to replicate, one origin moves rapidly toward the \nopposite end of the cell \n(Figure 12.12). While the chromo-\nsome is replicating, the cell elongates. When replication \nis complete and the bacterium has reached about twice its \ninitial size, proteins cause its plasma membrane to pinch \ninward, dividing the parent bacterial cell into two daughter \ncells. In this way, each cell inherits a complete genome.\nUsing the techniques of modern DNA technology to tag the \norigins of replication with molecules that glow green in fluo\n-\nrescence microscopy (see Figure 6.3), researchers have directly \nobs...\n\nells grown in culture. In these \nexperiments, two cells in different phases of the cell cycle were \nfused to form a single cell with two nuclei \n(Figure 12.14). If one \nof the original cells was in the S phase and the other was in \nG\n1\n,  \nthe \nG\n1\n nucleus immediately entered the S phase, as though \nstimulated by signaling molecules present in the cytoplasm of \nthe first cell. Similarly, if a cell undergoing mitosis (M phase) \nwas fused with another cell in any stage of its cell cycle, even \nG\n1\n, the second nucleus immediately entered mitosis, with con-\ndensation of the chromatin and formation of a mitotic spindle.\nThe experiment shown in Figure 12.14 and other experi-\nments on animal cells and yeasts demonstrated that the \nCONCEPT \n12.3\nURRY8743_12_SE_C12_PRF.indd   24411/6/19   9:07 AM\n\n CHAPTER 12   The Cell Cycle 245\ncontrol system (the molecular basis for the cell cycle clock) \nand describe how a cell progresses through the cycle.

When enough\nMPF molecules\naccumulate, the cell\npasses the G\n2\ncheckpoint and\nbegins mitosis.\n2\n     MPF promotes \nmitosis by phos-\nphorylating \nvarious proteins. \nMPF‘s activity\npeaks during \nmetaphase.\n3\n     During \nanaphase, the \ncyclin com-\nponent of MPF is \ndegraded,\nterminating the \nM phase. The\ncell enters the \nG\n1\n phase.\n4\n     Synthesis of cyclin \nbegins in late S phase \nand continues through \nG\n2\n. Because cyclin is \nprotected from degra-\ndation during this stage, \nit accumulates.\n. Figure 12.16 Molecular control of the cell cycle at the \nG\n2\n checkpoint. The steps of the cell cycle are timed by rhythmic \nfluctuations in the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks). Here we \nfocus on a cyclin-Cdk complex in animal cells called MPF, which acts at \nthe \nG\n2\n checkpoint as a go-ahead signal, triggering the events of mitosis.\nVISUAL SKILLS\n Explain how the events in the diagram in  \n(b) are related to the “Time” axis of the graph in (a), beginning at the left.\n Mastering Bi...\n\nual supply of nutrients; \nin essence, they are “immortal.” A striking example is a cell \nline that has been reproducing in culture since 1951.

The alleles for body color are b\n+\n (gray) and b (black), and those for wing size are vg\n+\n (normal) and vg (vestigial).\nResults\nConclusion\n  Since most offspring had a parental (P generation) \nphenotype, Morgan concluded that the genes for body color and wing \nsize are genetically linked on the same chromosome. Howev...\n\ns you proceed, be sure to keep in mind the distinction \nbetween the terms linked genes (two or more genes on the \nsame chromosome that tend to be inherited together) and \nsex-linked gene (a single gene on a sex chromosome).\nAs Figure 15.9 shows, both of the combinations of traits \nnot seen in the P generation (called nonparental phenotypes) \nwere also produced in Morgan’s experiments, suggesting that \nthe body color and wing size alleles are not always linked \ngenetically. To understand this conclusion, we need to fur\n-\nther explore genetic recombination, the production of \noffspring with combinations of traits that differ from those \nfound in either P generation parent.\nGenetic Recombination and Linkage\nMeiosis and random fertilization generate genetic variation \namong offspring of sexually reproducing organisms due to \nindependent assortment of chromosomes, crossing over in \nmeiosis I, and the possibility of any sperm fertilizing any egg \n(see Concept 13.4). Here we’ll examine the ch...\n\ne consistent with the hypoth-\nesis that the genes are unlinked.\nTo find the probability, locate your \nx\n2\n value in the \nx\n2\n \ndistribution table in Appendix D. The “degrees of freedom” \n(df) of your data set is the number of categories (here, \n4 phenotypes) minus 1, so df = 3. (a) Determine which values \non the df = 3 line of the table your calculated \nx\n2\n value lies \nbetween. (b) The column headings for these values show \nthe probability range for your \nx\n2\n number. Based on whether \nthere are nonsignificant (p . 0.05) or significant (\np...0.05) \ndifferences between the observed and expected values, are \nthe data consistent with the hypothesis that the two genes \nare unlinked and assorting independently, or is there enough \nevidence to reject this hypothesis?\n \nInstructors: A version of this Scientific Skills Exercise can be \nassigned in Mastering Biology.\nScientific Skills Exercise\n Cosmos plants\n*If the phenotype is dominant, a dash is used for the second allele; it \ncould be eith...\n\na set of traits—a syndrome—\ncharacteristic of the type of aneuploidy. Genetic disorders \ncaused by aneuploidy can be diagnosed before birth by fetal \ntesting (see Figure 14.19).\nDown Syndrome (Trisomy 21)\nOne aneuploid condition, Down syndrome, affects approxi-\nmately one out of every 830 children born in the United States \n(Figure 15.15). Down syndrome is usually the result of an \nextra chromosome 21, so that each body cell has a total of 47 \nchromosomes. Because the cells are trisomic for chromosome \n21, Down syndrome is often called trisomy 21. Down syn\n-\ndrome includes characteristic facial features, short stature, cor-\nrectable heart defects, and developmental delays. Individuals \nwith Down syndrome have an increased chance of developing \nleukemia and Alzheimer’s disease but have a lower rate of high \nblood pressure, atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries), \nstroke, and many types of solid tumors. People with Down \nsyndrome, on average, have a life span shorter than is typical...\n\ngeneration after generation.\nConsider, for example, the mouse gene for insulin-like growth \nfactor 2 (Igf2), one of the first imprinted genes to be identified. \nAlthough this growth factor is required for normal prenatal \ngrowth, only the paternal allele is expressed \n(Figure 15.17a). \nEvidence that the Igf2 gene is imprinted came initially from \ncrosses between normal-sized (wild-type) mice and dwarf \nPaternal\nchromosome\nNormal Igf2 allele\nis expressed.\nNormal Igf2 allele\nis not expressed.\nNormal-sized mouse\n(wild type)\nMaternal\nchromosome\nNormal Igf2 allele \nis expressed.\nMutant Igf2 allele \nis expressed.\nMutant Igf2 allele \nis not expressed.\nNormal-sized mouse (wild type)Dwarf mouse (mutant)\nMutant Igf2 allele \ninherited from mother\nMutant Igf2 allele \ninherited from father\nNormal Igf2 allele\nis not expressed.\n(a) \nHomozygote.

What scientists \nhave learned about eukaryotic DNA replication suggests, \nhowever, that most of the process is fundamentally similar \nfor prokaryotes and eukaryotes.\nGetting Started\nThe replication of chromosomal DNA begins at particular sites \ncalled origins of replication, short stretches of DNA that \nhave a specific sequence of nucleotides. The E. coli chromo\n-\nsome, like many other bacterial chromosomes, is circular and \nhas a single origin. Proteins that initiate DNA replication recog-\nnize this sequence and attach to the DNA, separating the two \nstrands and opening up a replication “bubble” \n(Figure 16.13a). \nReplication of DNA then proceeds in both directions until the \nentire molecule is copied. In contrast to a bacterial chromosome, \na eukaryotic chromosome may have hundreds or even a few \nthousand replication origins. Multiple replication bubbles form \nand eventually fuse, thus speeding up the...\n\ninciples are the same.\nMost DNA polymerases require a primer and a DNA tem\n-\nplate strand, along which complementary DNA nucleotides \nare lined up, one by one. In E. coli, DNA polymerase III (abbre-\nviated DNA pol III) adds a DNA nucleotide to the RNA primer \nand then continues adding DNA nucleotides, which are \ncomplementary to the parental DNA template strand, to the \ngrowing end of the new DNA strand. The rate of elongation \nis about 500 nucleotides per second in bacteria and 50 per \nsecond in human cells.\nEach nucleotide to be added to a growing DNA strand \nconsists of a sugar attached to a base and to three phosphate \ngroups. You have already encountered such a molecule—ATP \n(adenosine triphosphate; see Figure 8.9). The only difference \nbetween the ATP of energy metabolism and dATP, the adenine \nnucleotide used to make DNA, is the sugar component, which \nis deoxyribose in the building block of DNA but ribose in ATP. \nLike ATP, the nucleotides used for DNA synthesis are chemi\n-\ncal...\n\nNA, the Double Helix\nShown below is a ribbon model of DNA, \nwith each ribbon representing one of the \npolynucleotide strands. The TEM shows a \nmolecule of naked (protein-free) DNA; the \ndouble helix is 2 nm across.\nHistones\nProteins called histones are responsi-\nble for the main level of DNA packing \nin interphase chromatin. More than a \nfifth of a histone’s amino acids are \npositively charged (Lys or Arg) and \ntherefore bind tightly to the \nnegatively charged DNA.\n    Four types of histones are most \ncommon in chromatin. The histones \nare very similar among eukaryotes, \nprobably reflecting their important \nrole in chromatin structure.\nNucleosomes in a 10-nm Fiber\nIn electron micrographs, unfolded \nchromatin is roughly 10 nm in diame-\nter (the 10-nm fiber). Such chromatin \nresembles beads on a string (see the \nTEM). Each “bead” is a nucleosome, \nthe basic unit of DNA packing; the \n“string” between beads is called linker \nDNA.\n     A nucleosome consists of DNA \nwound twice around a prot...",

If, in our \nexample, the environment provides all the tryptophan the \ncell needs, the cell stops making the enzymes that catalyze \nthe synthesis of tryptophan (Figure 18.2b). In this case, the \ncontrol of enzyme production occurs at the level of transcrip\n-\ntion, the synthesis of messenger RNA from the genes that \ncode for these enzymes.\nRegulation of the tryptophan synthesis pathway is just \none example of how bacteria tune their metabolism to chang\n-\ning environments. Many genes of the bacterial genome are \nswitched on or off by changes in the metabolic status of the \ncell; some genes are regulated singly and others as groups of \nrelated genes. One basic mechanism for this type of regula\n-\ntion of groups of genes in bacteria, described as the operon \nmodel, was discovered in 1961 by François Jacob and Jacques \nMonod at the Pasteur Institute in Paris. Let’s see what an \noperon is and how it works.\nURRY8743_12_SE_C18_PRF.indd   36611/6/19   10:35 AM\n\n CHAPTER 18  ...\n\nperon are silenced (Figure 18.4a). \nIf lactose is added to the cell’s surroundings, allolactose binds \nto the lac repressor and alters its shape so the repressor can no \nlonger bind to the operator. Without the lac repressor bound, \nthe lac operon is transcribed into mRNA, and the enzymes for \nusing lactose are made (Figure 18.4b).\nIn the context of gene regulation, the enzymes of the lac\n-\ntose pathway are referred to as inducible enzymes because their \nsynthesis is induced by a chemical signal (allolactose, in this \ncase).

Over time, doctors found that the offspring of \nwomen in early pregnancy at that time experienced adverse \nhealth effects as adults: higher rates of obesity, high triglyc\n-\neride and cholesterol levels, type 2 diabetes, and schizophre-\nnia. Furthermore, the affected individuals had a 10% higher \nmortality rate after the age of 68 than their siblings who \nwere in utero when food was readily available.

The latter includes binding sites for \nthe other subunit and for other proteins.

Studies using yeast and mammalian cells show that \nsome activators recruit...\n\nnt. To understand how this works, we will \nconsider two basic developmental processes. First, we’ll \nexplore how cells that arise from early embryonic mitoses \ndevelop the differences that start each cell along its own \ndifferentiation pathway. Second, we’ll see how cellular dif\n-\nferentiation leads to one particular cell type, using muscle \ndevelopment as an example.\nCytoplasmic Determinants and Inductive \nSignals\nWhat generates the first differences among cells in an early \nembryo? And what controls the differentiation of all the vari-\nous cell types as development proceeds? You can probably \ndeduce the answer: The specific genes expressed in any par-\nticular cell of a developing organism determine its path. Two \nsources of information, used to varying extents in different \nspecies, “tell” a cell which genes to express at any given time \nduring embryonic development.\nOne important source of information early in develop\n-\nment is the egg’s cytoplasm, which contains both RNA and \nprote...\n\nthe \nmechanisms of development, it did not reveal the specific \nthe genes for proteins such as myosin and actin that confer \nthe unique properties of skeletal muscle cells.\nThe determination and differentiation of other kinds \nof tissues may play out in a similar fashion. Experimental \nresults support the idea that master regulatory proteins like \nMyoD might function by opening the chromatin in certain \nregions. This allows access to transcription machinery for \nactivation of the next set of cell-type-specific genes.\nPattern Formation: Setting Up the Body Plan\nWe have now seen how different programs of gene expression \nthat are activated in the fertilized egg can result in differenti-\nated cells and tissues. But for the tissues to function effectively \nin the organism as a whole, the organism’s body plan—its over-\nall three-dimensional arrangement—must be established and \nsuperimposed on the differentiation process. Let’s look at the \nmolecular basis for the establishment of the body p...\n\n-\ntion would surely be embryonic lethals, mutations with \nphenotypes causing death at the embryonic or larval stage. \nBecause organisms with embryonic lethal mutations never \nreproduce, they cannot be bred for study. The researchers \ndealt with this problem by looking for recessive mutations, \nwhich can be propagated in heterozygous flies that act as \ngenetic carriers. Third, cytoplasmic determinants in the egg \nwere known to play a role in axis formation, so the research\n-\ners knew they would have to study the mother’s genes as \nwell as those of the embryo. It is the mother’s genes that we \nwill discuss further as we focus on how the anterior-posterior \nbody axis is set up in the developing egg.\nNüsslein-Volhard and Wieschaus began their search for \nsegmentation genes by exposing flies to mutagenic agents \nand scanning their descendants for dead embryos or larvae \nwith abnormal segmentation or other defects. For example, \nto find genes that might set up the anterior-posterior axis, \nt...\n\nActivated  p53 promotes \ntranscription of the gene for       a \nprotein that inhibits the cell cycle. \nThe resulting suppression of cell \ndivision ensures that the damaged\nDNA is not replicated. If the DNA \ndamage is irreparable, then the p53\nsignal leads to apoptosis.\n(b) Mutant cell cycle–inhibiting \npathway. Mutations causing \ndeficiencies in any pathway \ncomponent can contribute to the \ndevelopment of cancer.\n.

The p21 protein halts the cell \ncycle by binding to cyclin-dependent kinases, allowing t...\n\nt effective, but new treatments are \nbeing developed.

They are obligate intracellular \nparasites; in other words, they can replicate only within a host \ncell. It is fair to say that viruses in isolation are merely pack\n-\naged sets of genes in transit from one host cell to another.\nEach particular virus can infect cells of only a limited \nnumber of host species, called the host range of the virus. \nThis host specificity results from the evolution of recognition \nsystems by the virus. Viruses usually identify host cells by a \n“handshake” fit between viral surface proteins and specific \nreceptor molecules on the outside of cells. Such receptor \nmolecules are most often proteins that carry out necessary \nfunctions for the host cell and have been adopted by viruses \nas portals of entry. Some viruses have broad host ranges. For \nexample, West Nile virus and equine encephalitis virus are \ndistinctly different viruses that can each infect mosquitoes, \nbirds, horses, and humans. Other viruses have host ranges so \nnarrow that they infect only a single species. Measles virus, for \ninstance, can infect only humans. Furthermore, viral infection \nof multicellular eukaryotes is usually limited to particular tis\n-\nsues. Human cold viruses infect only the cells lining the upper \nrespiratory tract, and the HIV seen in Figure 19.1\n binds to \nreceptors present only on certain types of immune cells.\nVIRUS\nDNA\nHOST CELL\nViral DNA\nViral DNA\nmRNA\nCapsid\nproteins\nCapsid\n      The virus enters\nthe cell and is uncoated,\nreleasing viral DNA\nand capsid proteins.\n1\n      Meanwhile, host\nenzymes transcribe the\nviral genome into viral\nmRNA, which host\nribosomes use to make\nmore capsid proteins.\n      Viral genomes\nand capsid proteins\nself-assemble int",

Once such suspected genes are identified, \nthe second step is to obtain clues about their identities and \nfunctions. Software is used to compare their sequences with \nthose of known genes from other o...\n\nbetween functional genes, however, \nis repetitive DNA, which consists of sequences that are \npresent in multiple copies in the genome.\nRepetitive\nDNA that\nincludes\ntransposable\nelements\nand related\nsequences \n(44%)\nExons (regions of genes \ncoding for protein or giving \nrise to rRNA or tRNA) (1.5%)\nRegulatory \nsequences (5%)\nIntrons\n(~20%)\nSimple sequence\nDNA (3%)\nAlu elements\n(10%)\nL1\nsequences\n(17%)\nLarge-segment\nduplications (5–6%)\nUnique\nnoncoding\nDNA (15%)\nRepetitive\nDNA\nunrelated to\ntransposable\nelements\n(14%)\n. Figure 21.6 Types of DNA sequences in the human genome. \nThe gene sequences that code for proteins or are transcribed into \nrRNA or tRNA molecules make up only about 1.5% of the human \ngenome (dark purple in the pie chart), while introns and regulatory \nsequences associated with genes (lighter purple) make up about \na quarter. The vast majority of the human genome does not code \nfor proteins (although much of it gives rise to RNAs), and a large \namount is repetitive DNA (d...\n\nusually not identical to each other. Some of these are trans\n-\nposable elements that can move; the enzymes required for \nthis movement may be encoded by any transposable ele-\nment, including the one that is moving. Others are related \nsequences that have lost the ability to move altogether. \nTransposable elements and related sequences make up \n25–50% of most mammalian genomes (see Figure 21.6) and \neven higher percentages in amphibians and many plants. In \nfact, the very large size of some plant genomes is accounted \nfor by extra transposable elements rather than by extra \ngenes. For example, transposable elements make up 85% of \nthe corn genome!\nIn humans and other primates, a large portion of trans\n-\nposable element–related DNA consists of a family of similar \nsequences called Alu elements. These sequences alone account \nfor approximately 10% of the human genome. Alu elements \nare about 300 nucleotides long, much shorter than most \nfunctional transposable elements, and they do not co...\n\ning occurred among their ances\n-\ntral species. You’ll learn more about the details of how poly-\nploidy leads to plant speciation in Concept 24.2.\nAlterations of Chromosome Structure\nWith the recent explosion in genomic sequence informa-\ntion, we can now compare the chromosomal organizations \nof many different species in detail. This information allows \nus to make inferences about the evolutionary processes that \nshape chromosomes and may drive speciation. For example, \nscientists have long known that sometime in the last 6 mil\n-\nlion years, when the ancestors of humans and chimpanzees \ndiverged as species, the fusion of two ancestral chromosomes \nCONCEPT \n21.5\nHuman\nchromosome\nChimpanzee\nchromosomes\n12\n213\nTelomere\nsequences\nCentromere\nsequences\nTelomere-like\nsequences\nCentromere-like\nsequences\n.

In one population, individuals of genotype AA are \nmost common (9,000 AA, 900 Aa, 100 aa), while the opposite \nis true in the other population (100 AA, 900 Aa, 9,000 aa). If \nneither allele has a selective advantage, what will happen \nover time to the allele and genotype frequencies of these \npopulations?\nFor suggested answers, see Appendix A.\nCONCEPT \n23.4\nNatural selection is the only \nmechanism that consistently \ncauses adaptive evolution\nEvolution by natural selection is a blend of chance and “sort-\ning”: chance in the creation of new genetic variations (as in \nmutation) and sorting as natural selection favors some alleles \nover others. Because of this favoring process, the outcome \nof natural selection is not random. Instead, natural selection \nconsistently increases the frequencies of alleles that provide \nreproductive advantage, thus leading to adaptive evolution.\nNatural Selection: A Closer Look\nTo see how natural selection can cause adaptive evolution, \nwe’ll begin with the concept of relative fitness and the differ-\nent ways that selection acts on an organism’s phenotype.\nRelative Fitness\nThe phrases “struggle for existence” and “survival of the fit-\ntest” are commonly used to describe natural selection, but \nthese expressions are misleading if always taken to mean \ndirect competitive contests among individuals. There are \nanimal species in which individuals, usually the males, lock \nhorns or otherwise do combat to determine mating privi\n-\nlege. But reproductive success is generally more subtle and \ndepends on many factors besides outright battle. For exam-\nple, a barnacle that is more efficient at collecting food than \nits neighbors may have greater stores of energy and hence \nbe able to produce a larger number of eggs. A moth may \nhave more offspring than other moths in the same popula\n-\ntion because its body colors more effectively conceal it from \npredators, improving its chance of surviving long enough to \nproduce more offspring. These examples illustrate how in a \ngiven environment, certain traits can lead to greater relative \nfitness: the contribution an individual makes to the gene \npool of the next generation relative to the contributions of \nother individuals.\nAlthough we often refer to the relative fitness of a geno\n-\ntype, remember that the entity that is subjected to natural \nselection is the whole organism, not the underlying geno-\ntype. Thus, selection acts more directly on the phenotype \nthan on the genotype; it acts on the genotype indirectly, via \nhow the genotype affects the phenotype.\nDirectional, Disruptive, and Stabilizing Selection\nNatural selection can alter the frequency distribution of heri-\ntable traits in three ways, depending on which phenotypes in \na population are favored: through directional selection, dis-\nruptive selection, and stabilizing selection.\nDirectional selection occurs when conditions \nfavor individuals exhibiting one extreme of a phenotypic \nfrom islands are unbanded or intermediate. Banding color\n-\nation is an inherited trait, determined by a few loci (with alleles \nthat encode bands being dominant to alleles that encode the \nabsence of bands). On islands, water snakes live along rocky \nshorelines, while on the mainland, they live in marshes. Snakes \nwithout bands are more well camouflaged in island habitats \nthan are snakes with bands. Hence, on islands, snakes without \nbands survive at higher rates than do snakes with bands.\nThese data indicate that snakes without bands are favored \nby natural selection in island populations. Thus, we might \nexpect that all snakes on islands would lack bands. Why \nis this not the case? The answer lies in gene flow from the \nmainland. In any given year, three to ten snakes from the \nmainland swim to the islands and join the populations there. \nAs a result, each ye"

Once their heads have\nmoved slightly past each other, the\nsnails’ genitals emerge, and if their\nshells spiral in the same direction,\nmating can occur (f).

Typically, gene flow occurs between the \ndifferent populations of a species. This ongoing exchange of \nalleles tends to hold the populations together genetically. \nBut as we’ll explore in this chapter, a reduction or lack of \ngene flow can play a key role in the formation of n...\n\nRRY8743_12_SE_C24_PRF.indd   51011/8/19   5:11 PM\n\n CHAPTER 24   The Origin of Species 511\nand the seeds of some flowering plants. In contrast, small \nrodents may find a river or canyon a formidable barrier.\nOnce geographic isolation has occurred, the separated \ngene pools may diverge. Different mutations arise, and natu\n-\nral selection and genetic drift may alter allele frequencies in \ndifferent ways in the separated populations. Reproductive iso-\nlation may then evolve as a by-product of the genetic diver-\ngence that results from selection or drift.\nFigure 24.6 describes an example. On Andros Island, in \nthe Bahamas, populations of the mosquitofish Gambusia \nhubbsi colonized a series of ponds that later became isolated \nfrom one another. Genetic analyses indicate that little or \nno gene flow currently occurs between the ponds. The envi\n-\nronments of these ponds are very similar except that some \ncontain predatory fishes, while others do not. In ponds with \npredatory fishes, selection...\n\nulations raised on starch digested starch more \nefficiently, while those raised on maltose digested maltose more \nefficiently. The researcher then put flies from the same or differ-\nent populations in mating cages and measured mating frequen-\ncies. All flies used in the mating preference tests were reared for \none generation on a standard cornmeal medium.\nto reproduction between mosquitofish from ponds with \npredators and those from ponds without predators. Thus, as a \nby-product of selection for avoiding predators, reproductive \nbarriers have formed in these allopatric populations.\nEvidence of Allopatric Speciation\nMany studies provide evidence that speciation can occur in \nallopatric populations. For example, laboratory studies show \nthat reproductive barriers can develop when populations are \nisolated experimentally and subjected to different environ\n-\nmental conditions \n(Figure 24.7).\nField studies indicate that allopatric speciation also can \noccur in nature. Consider the 30 speci...\n\nare sterile because their chromosomes are \nnot homologous and cannot pair during meiosis. However, such \na hybrid may be able to reproduce asexually. This diagram traces \none mechanism by which sterile hybrids can give rise to fertile \nallopolyploids that are members of a new species.\nURRY8743_12_SE_C24_PRF.indd   51411/8/19   5:11 PM\n\n CHAPTER 24   The Origin of Species 515\nEast when an early cultivated wheat species hybridized with \na wild grass. Today, plant geneticists generate new polyploids \nin the laboratory by using chemicals that induce meiotic \nand mitotic errors. By harnessing the evolutionary process, \nresearchers can produce new polyploid species with desired \nqualities, such as a polyploid that combines the high yield of \nwheat with the hardiness of rye.\n Mastering Biology  Animation: Speciation by Changes  \nin Ploidy\nSexual Selection\nThere is evidence that sympatric speciation can also be driven \nby sexual selection. Clues to how this can occur have been \nfound in cichli...\n\nern of allele frequencies across a \nhybrid zone? We can infer that there is an obstacle to gene \nflow—otherwise, alleles from one parent species would also \nbe common in the gene pool of the other parent species. Are \ngeographic barriers reducing gene flow? Not in this case, \nsince the toads can move throughout the hybrid zone. A \nmore important factor is that hybrid toads have increased \nrates of embryonic mortality and a variety of morphological \nabnormalities, including ribs that are fused to the spine and \nmalformed tadpole mouthparts. Because the hybrids have \npoor survival and reproduction, they produce few viable off\n-\nspring with members of the parent species. As a result, hybrid \nindividuals rarely serve as a stepping-stone from which alleles \nare passed from one species to the other. Outside the hybrid \nzone, additional obstacles to gene flow may be provided by \nnatural selection in the different environments in which the \nparent species live.\nHybrid zones typically are locat...\n\na-\ntions than for allopatric populations.\nURRY8743_12_SE_C24_PRF.indd   51811/8/19   5:11 PM\n\n CHAPTER 24   The Origin of Species 519\nPopulation\nBarrier to\ngene flow\nHybrid\nindividual\nHybrid\nzone\nGene flow\n     Three\npopulations\nof a species\nare connected\nby gene flow.\n1\n     A barrier\nto gene flow\nis established.\n2\n     Gene flow is\nre-established in\na hybrid zone.\n4\n     Possible outcomes for hybrids:\nReinforcement\n(strengthening\nof reproductive\nbarriers—hybrids\ngradually cease\nto be formed)\nFusion\n(weakening of\nreproductive\nbarriers—the\ntwo species fuse)\nStability\n(continued\nproduction of\nhybrid individuals)\nOR\nOR\n5\n     This population\nbegins to diverge\nfrom the other \ntwo populations.\n3\n.

It turns out that the total time between speciation events \nvaries considerably. In a survey of data from 84 groups of plants \nand animals, speciation intervals ranged from 4,000 years (in \ncichlids of Lake Nabugabo, Uganda) to 40 million years (in some \nbeetles). Overall, the time between speciation events averaged \n6.5 million years and was rarely less than 500,000 years.\nThese data suggest that on average, millions of years may \npass before a newly formed plant or animal species will itself \ngive rise to another new species.

Speciation fascinated Darwin (and many biologists \nsince) because it has produced the tremendous diversity of \nlife, repeatedly yielding new species that differ from existing \nones. Speciation also helps to explain the many features that \norganisms share (the unity of life): When one species splits \ninto two, the species that result share many characteristics \nbecause they are descended from this common ancestor. For \nexample, at the DNA sequence level, such similarities indi\n-\ncate that the flightless cormorant in Figure 24.1 is closely \nrelated to flying cormora...\n\nl. This “oxygen revolution” had an enormous \nimpact on life. In some of its chemical forms, oxygen attacks \nchemical bonds and can inhibit enzymes and damage cells. \nAs a result, the rising concentration of atmospheric O\n2\n proba-\nbly doomed many prokaryotic groups. Some species survived \nin habitats that remained anaerobic, where we find their \ndescendants living today (see Concept 27.4). Among other \nsurvivors, diverse adaptations to the changing atmosphere \nevolved, including cellular respiration, which uses O\n2\n in the \nprocess of harvesting the energy stored in organic molecules.\n1,000\n0.0001\n0.001\n0.01\n0.1\n1\n10\n100\n43210\nTime (billions of years ago)\n“Oxygen\nrevolution”\nAtmospheric O\n2\n(percent of present-day level; log scale)\n.

Recent DNA analyses sug\n-\ngest that sponges had evolved by 700 million years ago; \nsuch analyses also indicate that the common ancestor of \narthropods, chordates, and other animal phyla that radi\n-\nated during the Cambrian explosion lived 670 million years \nago. Researchers have unearthed 710-million-year-old sedi-\nments containing steroids indicative of a particular group \nof sponges—a finding that supports the molecular data. \nIn contrast, the oldest macroscopic fossils of animals date \nfrom 560 million years ago and include Kimberella, shown \nin Figure 25.11. Overall, fossils and DNA analyses suggest \nthat animals originated about 700 million years ago and \nthen remained small...\n\nl mammals originated in what is now Asia and \nreached Australia via South America and Antarctica while the \ncontinents were still joined. The subsequent breakup of the \nsouthern continents set Australia “afloat,” like a giant raft \nof marsupials. In Australia, marsupials diversified, and the \nfew eutherians (placental mammals) that lived there became \nextinct; on other continents, most marsupials became extinct \nand the eutherians diversified.\nFinally, continental drift can help explain puzzling geo\n-\ngraphic distributions of extinct organisms, such as fossils \nof the same species of Permian freshwater reptiles found in \nboth Brazil and the West African nation of Ghana.

From a phylogeny \nof maize based on DNA data, researchers have identified two \nspecies of wild grasses that may be maize’s closest living rela\n-\ntives. These two close relatives may be useful as “reservoirs” \nof beneficial alleles that can be transferred to cultivated maize \nby cross-breeding or genetic engineering.\nA different use of phylogenetic trees is to infer species iden\n-\ntities by analy...\n\non ancestor (it excludes cetaceans).\nThis group is polyphyletic because it \ndoes not include the most recent \ncommon ancestor of its members.\n. Figure 26.11 Paraphyletic versus polyphyletic groups.\nURRY8743_12_SE_C26_PRF.indd   56011/8/19   5:51 PM\n\n CHAPTER 26   Phylogeny and the Tree of Life 561\nin the ingroup. Thus, for a character that only occurs in a sub-\nset of the ingroup, we’ll assume that the character arose in the \nlineage leading to those members of the ingroup.\nBy comparing members of the ingroup with each other \nand with the outgroup, we can determine which characters \nwere derived at the various branch points of vertebrate evo\n-\nlution. In our example, all of the vertebrates in the ingroup \nhave backbones: This character was present in the ancestral \nvertebrate, but not in the outgroup. Now note that hinged \njaws are absent in the outgroup and in lampreys, but pres\n-\nent in all other members of the ingroup. This indicates that \nhinged jaws arose in a lineage leading to a...\n\nanges that have \ntaken place in a particular DNA sequence in that lineage. \nNote that the total length of the horizontal lines from the \nbase of the tree to the mouse is less than that of the line \nleading to the fruit fly, Drosophila. This indicates that fewer \ngenetic changes have occurred in the mouse lineage than in \nthe Drosophila lineage. In addition, because the mouse and fly \nlineages have evolved for an equal amount of time after they \ndiverged from a common ancestor, the rate of change was \nlower in mouse lineage than in the Drosophila lineage.\nIn general, although the branches of a phylogenetic tree \nmay have different lengths, among organisms alive today, \nall the different lineages that descend from a common ances\n-\ntor have survived for the same number of years. To take an \nextreme example, humans and bacteria had a common ances-\ntor that lived over 3 billion years ago. Fossils and genetic \nevidence indicate that this ancestor was a single-celled pro-\nkaryote. Even though...\n\nnships among all organisms. It is also helpful to know \nwhen lineages diverged from one another, including those \nfor which there is no fossil record. But how can we deter\n-\nmine the timing of phylogenies that extend beyond the \nfossil record?\nMolecular Clocks\nWe stated earlier that researchers have estimated that the \ncommon ancestor of Hawaiian silversword plants lived about \n5 million years ago. How did they make this estimate? They \nrelied on the concept of a molecular clock, an approach \nfor measuring the absolute time of evolutionary change \nbased on the observation that some genes and other regions \nof genomes appear to evolve at constant rates. An assump\n-\ntion underlying the molecular clock is that the number of \nnucleotide substitutions in orthologous genes is proportional \nto the time that has elapsed since the genes branched from \ntheir common ancestor. In the case of paralogous genes, the \nnumber of substitutions is proportional to the time since the \nancestral gene was du...",

Reductionism is a powerful strategy in biol-\nogy. For example, by studying the molecular structure of DNA \nthat had been extracted from cells, James Watson and Francis \nCrick inferred the chemical basis of biological inheritance. \nDespite its importance, reductionism provides an incomplete \nview of life on Earth, as you’ll see next.\nEmergent Properties\nLet’s reexamine Figure 1.3, beginning...\n\nnew generations in a short period of time; as a result, resistant \nstrains of these pathogens can proliferate very quickly.\nConsider the evolution of drug resistance in the bacterium \nStaphylococcus aureus. About one in three people harbor this \nspecies on their skin or in their nasal passages with no negative \neffects. However, certain genetic varieties (strains) of this species, \nknown as methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), are formidable \npathogens. Most MRSA infections are caused by recently appear\n-\ning strains such as clone USA300, which can cause “flesh-eating \ndisease” and potentially fatal infections \n(Figure 22.14). How did \nclone USA300 and other strains of MRSA become so dangerous?\nThe story begins in 1943, when penicillin became the first \nwidely used antibiotic. Since then, penicillin and other anti\n-\nbiotics have saved millions of lives. However, by 1945, more \nthan 20% of the S. aureus strains seen in hospitals were already \nresistant to penicillin. These bacteria h...\n\nhin a single cell.\nCell-Surface Structures\nA key feature of nearly all prokaryotic cells is the cell wall, \nwhich maintains cell shape, protects the cell, and prevents it \nfrom bursting in a hypotonic environment (see Figure 7.13). \nIn a hypertonic environment, most prokaryotes lose water \nand shrink away from their wall. Such water losses can inhibit \ncell reproduction. Thus, salt can be used to preserve foods \nbecause it causes food-spoiling prokaryotes to lose water, \n preventing them from reproducing rapidly.\nThe cell walls of prokaryotes differ in structure from those \nof eukaryotes. In eukaryotes that have cell walls, such as \nplants and fungi, the walls are usually made of cellulose or \nchitin (see Concept 5.2). In contrast, most bacterial cell walls \ncontain peptidoglycan, a polymer composed of modified \nsugars cross-linked by short polypeptides.

Among prokaryotes, bacterial and archaeal \nflagella are similar in size and rotational mechanism, but they \nare composed of entirely different and unrelated proteins. \nOverall, these structural and molecular comparisons indicate \nthat the flagella of bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes arose \nindependently. Since current evidence shows that the flagella \nof organisms in the three domains perform similar functions \nbut are not related by common descent, they are described as \nanalogous, not homologous, structures (see Concept 22.3).\nEvolutionary Origins of Bacterial Flagella\nThe bacterial flagellum shown in Figure 27.7 has three main \nparts (the motor, hook, and filament) that are themselves \ncomposed of 42 different kinds of proteins. How could such \na complex structure evolve? In fact, much evidence indicates \nthat bacterial flagella originated as simpler structures that were \nmodified in a stepwise fashion over time.

Such organelles provide specific locations where \nparticular cellular functions are accomplished, making the \nstructure and organization of eukaryotic cells more complex \nthan those of prokaryotic cells. Eukaryotic cells also have a \nwell-developed cytoskeleton that extends throughout the \ncell (see Figure 6.20). The cytoskeleton provides the struc\n-\ntural support that enables eukaryotic cells to have asym-\nmetric (irregular) forms, as well as to change in shape as \nthey feed...\n\nimportant and how ongoing research is \nelucidating their evolutionary relationships.\nURRY8743_12_SE_C28_PRF.indd   59711/8/19   6:25 PM\n\n598 UNIT FIVE   The Evolutionary History of Biological Diversity\nThe tree below represents a phylogenetic hypothesis for the relationships among eukaryotes on \nEarth today. The eukaryotic groups at the branch tips are related in larger “supergroups,” labeled \nvertically at the far right of the tree. Groups that were formerly classified in the kingdom Protista \nare highlighted in yellow. Dotted lines indicate evolutionary relationships that are uncertain. For \nclarity, this tree only includes representative clades from each supergroup. In addition, the recent \ndiscoveries of many new groups of eukaryotes indicate that eukaryotic diversity is actually much \ngreater than shown here.\nSome members of this supergroup (whose \nmonophyly has been called into question \nby some recent genomic studies) have an \n“excavated” groove on one side of \nthe cell body. Tw...\n\nat \nCO\n2\n was indeed pumped to the ocean floor \nafter iron was added to a small region of the ocean. Further \ntests are planned to examine whether iron fertilization has \nundesirable side effects (such as oxygen depletion or the \nproduction of nitrous oxide, a more potent greenhouse \ngas than \nCO\n2\n).\nBrown Algae\nThe largest and most complex algae are brown algae. All are \nmulticellular, and most are marine. Brown algae are especially \ncommon along temperate coasts that have cold-water cur\n-\nrents. They owe their characteristic brown or olive color to \nthe carotenoids in their plastids.\nMany of the species commonly called “seaweeds” are brown \nalgae. Some brown algal seaweeds have specialized structures \nthat resemble organs in plants, such as a rootlike holdfast, \nwhich anchors the alga, and a stemlike stipe, which supports \nthe leaflike blades \n(Figure 28.13). Unlike plants, however, \nbrown algae lack true tissues and organs. Moreover, morpho-\nlogical and DNA data show that these sim...\n\nmale and female gametophytes, which produce gametes. \nThe union of two gametes (fertilization) results in a diploid \nzygote, which matures and gives rise to a new multicellular \nsporophyte.\nIn Laminaria, the two generations are heteromorphic, \nmeaning that the sporophytes and gametophytes are struc\n-\nturally different. Other algal life cycles have an alternation \nof isomorphic generations, in which the sporophytes and \ngametophytes look similar to each other, although they differ \nin chromosome number.\nOomycetes (Water Molds and Their Relatives)\nOomycetes include the water molds, the white rusts, \nand the downy mildews. Based on their morphology, \nthese organisms were previously classified as fungi (in \nfact, oomycete means “egg fungus”). For example, many \noomycetes have multinucleate filaments (hyphae) that \nresemble fungal hyphae \n(Figure 28.15a).

As \na result, differences among these genes reflect the history \nof speciation events that have occurred since the eukaryotes \nbegan to diverge from their last common ancestor—making \nthese genes well suited for inferring the root of the eukary-\notic tree. Derelle and colleagues obtained the sequences of \nthese genes for 67 species of eukaryotes representing a wide \nrange of eukaryotic taxa.

The \nabundance of diatoms \nin the past is also evident \nin the fossil record, where \nmassive accumulations of \nfossilized diatom walls are \nmajor constituents of sediments known as diatomaceous earth. \nThese sediments are mined for their quality as a filtering \nmedium and for many other uses.\nDiatoms are so widespread and abundant that their pho\n-\ntosynthetic activity affects global carbon dioxide (\nCO\n2\n) lev-\nels. Diatoms have this effect in part because of events that \noccur during episodes of rapid population growth, or blooms, \nwhen ample nutrients are available. Typically, diatoms are \neaten by a variety of protists and invertebrates, but during a \nbloom, many escape this fate. When these uneaten diatoms \ndie, their bodies sink to the ocean floor. It takes decades, or \neven centuries, for dead diatoms that sink to the ocean floor \nto be broken down by bacteria and other decomposers. As a \nresult, the carbon in their bodies remains there for some time, \nrather than being released immediately as \nCO\n2\n as the decom-\nposers respire.

Hornworts \nare frequently among the first species to colonize open areas with \nmoist soils; a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing cyanobac-\nteria contributes to their ability to do this (nitrogen is often in \nshort supply in such areas).\nHornworts (Phylum Anthocerophyta)\nMoss gametophytes, which range in height from less than 1 mm \nto 60 cm, are less than 15 cm tall in most species.

Explain.\nFor suggested answers, see Appendix A.\nLife Cycles with Dominant Sporophytes\nAs mentioned earlier, mosses and other bryophytes have life \ncycles dominated by gametophytes (see Figure 29.11). Fossil \nevidence suggests that a change began to develop in some of the \nearliest vascular plants, whose gametophytes and sporophytes \nwere about equal in size. Further reductions in gametophyte size \noccurred among extant vascular plants; in these groups, the spo\n-\nrophyte generation is the larger and more complex form in the \nalternation of generations \n(Figure 29.17). In ferns, for example, \nthe familiar leafy plants are the sporophytes. You would have to \nget down on your hands and knees and search the ground care\n-\nfully to find fern gametophytes, which are tiny structures that \noften grow on or just below the soil surface.\nTransport in Xylem and Phloem\nVascular plants have two types of vascular tissue: xylem and \nphloem (see Figure 35.10). Xylem conducts most of the \nwater and minerals. The xylem of all vascular plants includes \ntracheids, tube-shaped cells that carry water and minerals \nup from the roots. The water-conducting cells of the xylem \nare dead at functional maturity and are lignified; that is, their \ncell walls are strengthened by the polymer lignin.

(The entire set of proteins \nexpressed by a given cell, tissue, or organism is called a \nproteome.)\nThree important research developments have made the \ngenomic and proteomic approaches possible. One is “high-\nthroughput” technology, tools that can analyze many bio\n-\nlogical samples very rapidly. The second major development \nis bioinformatics, the use of computational tools to store, \norganize, and analyze the huge volume of data that results \nfrom high-throughput methods. The third development is \nthe formation of interdisciplinary research teams—groups \nof diverse specialists that may include computer scientists, \nmathematicians, engineers, chemists, physicists, and, of \ncourse, biologists from a variety of fields.

Each megasporangium has one megaspore, \nwhereas each microsporangium has many microspores.\nAs noted previously, the miniaturization of seed plant \ngametophytes probably contributed to the great success of \nthis clade. Next, we’ll look at the development of the female \ngametophyte within an ovule and the development of the \nmale gametophyte in a pollen grain. Then we’ll follow the \ntransformation of a fertilized ovule into a seed.\nOvules and Production of Eggs\nAlthough a few species of seedless plants are heterosporous, \nseed plants are unique in retaining the megasporangium within \nthe parent sporophyte. A layer of sporophyte tissue called \nintegument envelops and protects the megasporangium. \nGymnosperm megasporangia are surrounded by one integument, \nVISUAL SKILLS Based on this figure, a gymnosperm seed contains cells from how many different \nplant generations? Identify the cells and whether each is hap...\n\ncale has two ovules, \neach containing a megasporangium. Only \none ovule is shown.\n  In most conifer species, each tree \nhas both ovulate and pollen cones.\n     Fertilization usually occurs more than a year \nafter pollination. All eggs may be fertilized, \nbut usually only one zygote develops into an \nembryo. The ovule becomes a seed, consisting \nof an embryo, food supply, and seed coat.\n     While the pollen \ntube develops, the \nmegasporocyte \nundergoes meiosis, \nproducing four \nhaploid cells. One \nsurvives as a \nmegaspore.\n     The megaspore \ndevelops into a female \ngametophyte that \ncontains two or three \narchegonia, each of \nwhich will form an egg.\n     Pollination occurs \nwhen a pollen grain \nreaches the ovule. The \npollen grain then \ngerminates, forming a  \npollen tube that slowly \ndigests its way through \nthe megasporangium.\n. Figure 30.4 The life cycle of a pine.\nMAKE CONNECTIONS What type of cell division occurs as a megaspore \ndevelops into a female gametophyte? Explain. (See F...\n\nreproduction. Stamens are microsporophylls: They produce \nmicrospores that develop into pollen grains containing male \ngametophytes. A stamen consists of a stalk called the filament \nand a terminal sac, the anther, where pollen is produced. \nCarpels are megasporophylls: They produce megaspores that \ngive rise to female gametophytes. The carpel is the “container” \nmentioned earlier in which seeds are enclosed; as such, it is \na key structure that distinguishes angiosperms from gymno\n-\nsperms. At the tip of the carpel is a sticky stigma that receives \npollen. A style leads from the stigma to a structure at the \nbase of the carpel, the ovary; the ovary contains one or more \novules. As in gymnosperms, each angiosperm ovule contains a \nfemale gametophyte. If fertilized, an ovule develops into a seed.\nA flower may have one or more carpels. In many species, \nmultiple carpels are fused into one structure. The term pistil \nis sometimes used to refer to a single carpel (a simple pistil) or \ntwo ...\n\nllen tube. Each ovule, which develops in the ovary, contains \na female gametophyte, also known as an embryo sac. The \nembryo sac consists of only a few cells, one of which is the egg.\nAfter its release from the anther, the pollen is carried to \nthe sticky stigma at the tip of a carpel. Although some flow\n-\ners self-pollinate, most have mechanisms that ensure cross- \npollination, which in angiosperms is the transfer of pollen \nfrom an anther of a flower on one plant to the stigma of a \nThe Angiosperm Life Cycle\nYou can follow a typical angiosperm life cycle in Figure 30.12. \nThe flower of the sporophyte produces microspores that form \nmale gametophytes and megaspores that form female game\n-\ntophytes. The male gametophytes are in the pollen grains, \nwhich develop within microsporangia in the anthers. Each \nmale gametophyte has two haploid cells: a generative cell that \ndivides, forming two sperm, and a tube cell that produces a \nHaploid (n)\nKey\nDiploid (2n)\nFERTILIZATION\nMEIOSIS\n      Wh...\n\nring Darwin’s lifetime.\nCan we infer traits of the angiosperm common ancestor \nfrom traits found in early fossil angiosperms? Archaefructus, \nfor example, was herbaceous and had bulbous structures \nthat may have served as floats, suggesting it was aquatic. But \ninvestigating whether the angiosperm common ancestor \nwas herbaceous and aquatic also requires examining fossils \nof other seed plants thought to have been closely related to \nangiosperms. All of those plants were woody, indicating that \nthe common ancestor was probably woody and probably not \naquatic. As we’ll see, this conclusion has been supported by \nrecent phylogenetic analyses.\nAngiosperm Phylogeny\nMolecular and morphological evidence suggests that extant \ngymnosperm lineages had diverged from the lineage leading \nto angiosperms by 305 million years ago. Note that this does \nnot imply that angiosperms originated 305 million years \nago, but that the most recent common ancestor of extant \ngymnosperms and angiosperms lived at...\n\nthe impact of a flow\n-\ner’s symmetry (see Figure 30.9). On a flower with bilateral sym-\nmetry, an insect pollinator can obtain nectar (a sugary solution \nsecreted by flower glands) only when landing in a certain posi-\ntion \n(Figure 30.15). This constraint makes it more likely that \npollen is placed on a part of the insect’s body that will come \ninto contact with the stigma of a flower of the same species. \nSuch specificity of pollen transfer reduces gene flow between \ndiverging populations and could lead to increased rates of spe\n-\nciation in plants with bilateral symmetry. This hypothesis can \nbe tested using the approach illustrated in this diagram:\n“Bilateral” clade\nCompare \nnumbers\nof species\nTime since divergence\nfrom common ancestor\nCommon\nancestor\n“Radial” clade\nMonocot\nCharacteristics\nEudicot\nCharacteristics\nEmbryos\nOne cotyledonVeins usually\nparallel\nVascular tissue\nscattered\nRoot system\nusually fibrous\n(no main root)\nPollen grain with\none opening\nFloral organs\nusually in\nmult...",

The first \ngenome of a mycorrhizal fungus to \nbe sequenced was that of the basidio-\nmycete Laccaria bicolor (see photo). In \nnature, L. bicolor is a common ectomy-\ncorrhizal fungus of trees such as poplar and fir, as well as a free-living \nsoil organism. In forest nurseries, it is often added to soil to enhance \nseedling growth. The fungus can easily be grown alone in culture \nand can establish mycorrhizae with tree roots in the laboratory. \nResearchers hope that studying the genome of Laccaria will yield clues \nto the processes by which it interacts with its mycorrhizal partners—\nand by extension, to mycorrhizal interactions involving other fungi.\nHow the Study Was Done  Using the whole-genome shot-\ngun method (see Figure 21.2) and bioinformatics, researchers \nsequenced the genome of L. bicolor and compared it with the \ngenomes of some nonmycorrhizal basidiomycete fungi. The team \nused microarrays to compare gene expression levels for different \nprotein-coding genes and for the same genes in a mycorrhizal \nmycelium and a free-living mycelium. They could thus identify the \ngenes for fungal proteins that are made specifically in mycorrhizae.\nData from the Study\nData from F.

As a result, systematists now recognize \nthat fungi and animals are more closely related to each other \nthan either group is to plants or to most other eukaryotes.\nThe Origin of Fungi\nPhylogenetic analyses suggest that fungi evolved from a flag-\nellated ancestor. While the majority of fungi lack flagella, two \nbasal lineages of fungi (the cryptomycetes and the chytrids, \nas we’ll discuss shortly) do have flagella. Moreover, most of \nthe protists that share a close common ancestor with animals \nand fungi also have flagella. DNA sequence data indicate that \nthese three groups of eukaryotes—the fungi, the animals, \nand their protistan relatives—form a monophyletic group, or \nclade \n(Figure 31.8). As discussed in Concept 28.5, members \nof this clade are called opisthokonts, a name that refers \nto the posterior (opistho-) location of the flagellum in these \norganisms.\nWithin the opisthokont clade, fungi are more closely \nrelated to several groups of single-celled protists than they \nare to animals, suggesting that the ancestor of fungi was \nunicellular. One such group of unicellular protists, the \nnucleariids, consists of amoebas that feed on algae and \nbacteria. DNA evidence further indicates that animals are \nmore closely related to a different group of protists (the \nchoanoflagellates) than they are to either fungi or nucleariids. \nTogether, these results suggest that multicellularity evolved \nin animals and fungi independently, from different single-\ncelled ancestors.\nUsing molecular clock analyses, scien\n-\ntists have estimated that the ancestors of \nanimals and fungi diverged into separate \nlineages more than a billion years ago. \nFoss",

As \nthe fossil record clearly shows, life has been evolving for bil\n-\nlions of years, resulting in a vast diversity of past and present \norganisms. But along with the diversity there is also unity, in \nthe form of shared features. For example, while sea horses, \njackrabbits, hummingbirds, and giraffes all look very differ\n-\nent, their skeletons are organized in the same basic way.\nThe scientific explanation for the unity and diversity of \norganisms is evolution: a process of biological change in \nwhich species accumulate differences from their ancestors as \nthey adapt to different environments over time. Thus, we can \naccount for differences between two species (diversity) with the \nidea that certain heritable changes occurred after the two spe\n-\ncies diverged from their common ancestor. However, they also \nshare certain traits (unity) simply because they have descended \nfrom a common ancestor. An abundance of evidence of differ\n-\nent types supports the occurrence of evolution and the mecha-\nnisms that describe how it takes place, which we’ll explore in \ndetail in Chapters 22–25. To quote one of the founders of mod-\nern evolutionary theory, Theodosius Dobzhansky, “Nothing in \nbiology makes sense except in the light of evolution.” To under-\nstand this statement, we need to examine how biologists think \nabout the vast diversity of life on the planet.\nURRY8743_12_SE_C01_PRF.indd   1111/6/19   5:16 AM\n\n12 CHAPTER 1    Evolution, the Themes of Biology, and Scientific Inquiry \nThe Three Domains of Life\nHumans tend to group diverse items according to their similari-\nties and relationships to each other. Consequently, biologists \nhave long used careful comparisons of structure, function, and \nother obvious features to classify forms of life into groups. In the \nlast few decades, new methods of assessing species relationships, \nsuch as comparisons of DNA sequences, have led to a reevaluation \nof the classification of life. Although this reevaluation is ongoing, \nbiologists currently place all organisms into three groups called \ndomains: Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya \n(",

At the anterior end\nof the worm, near the main sources\nof sensory input, is a pair of ganglia,\ndense clusters of nerve cells.\nDigestion is completed ...\n\nion.\nSeeking to understand how they persist without males, \nresearchers have been studying a clade of asexual rotifers \nnamed Bdelloidea. Some 360 species of bdelloid rotifers \nare known, and all of them reproduce by parthenogenesis \nwithout any males. Paleontologists have discovered bdelloid \nrotifers preserved in 35-million-year-old amber, and the mor\n-\nphology of these fossils resembles only the female form, with \nno evidence of males. Molecular clock analyses indicate that \nbdelloids have been asexual for over 50 million years. While \nit appears that they do not reproduce sexually, bdelloid roti\n-\nfers may be able to generate genetic diversity in other ways. \nFor example, bdelloids can tolerate very high levels of desic-\ncation. When conditions improve and their cells rehydrate, \nDNA from other species enters their cells through cracks in \nthe plasma membrane. Recent evidence suggests that this \nforeign DNA can be incorporated into the bdelloids’ genome, \nthereby leading to increas...\n\npearl \nmussels, they are among the world’s most imperiled animal groups.\nURRY8743_12_SE_C33_PRF.indd   70211/8/19   6:40 PM\n\n CHAPTER 33    An Introduction to Invertebrates  703\nEach parapodium has numerous chaetae. (Possession of \nparapodia with numerous chaetae is not unique to Errantia, \nhowever, as some members of the other major clade of anne\n-\nlids, Sedentaria, also have these features.) In many species, \nthe parapodia are richly supplied with blood vessels and also \nfunction as gills. Errantians also tend to have well-developed \njaws and sensory organs, as might be expected of predators or \ngrazers that move about in search of food.\nSedentarians\nSpecies in the other major clade of annelids, Sedentaria (from \nthe Latin sedere, sit), tend to be less mobile than those in \nErrantia. Some species burrow slowly through marine sediments \nor soil, while others live within tubes that protect and support \ntheir soft bodies. Tube-dwelling sedentarians often have elabo\n-\nrate gills or tenta...\n\nair of appendages called pedipalps that function in sensing, \nfeeding, defense, or reproduction; and four pairs of walk\n-\ning legs. Spiders use their fang-like chelicerae, which are \nequipped with poison glands, to attack prey. As the chelicerae \npierce the prey, the spider secretes digestive juices onto the \nprey’s torn tissues. The food softens, and the spider sucks up \nthe liquid meal. In most spiders, gas exchange is carried out \nby book lungs, stacked platelike structures contained in an \ninternal chamber \n(Figure 33.33). The extensive surface area \nof these respiratory organs enhances the exchange of O\n2\n and \nCO\n2\n between the hemolymph and air.\nA unique adaptation of many spiders is the ability to catch \ninsects by constructing webs of silk, a liquid protein produced \n.

Figure 33.39  Anatomy of a grasshopper, an insect. The insect body has three regions: \nhead, thorax, and post-genital region. The segmentation of the thorax and post-genital region \nis obvious, but the segments that form the head are fused.\nURRY8743_12_SE_C33_PRF.indd   71011/8/19   6:41 PM\n\n CHAPTER 33    An Introduction to Invertebrates  711\ndiversity of particular insect groups have often been associated \nwith radiations of the flowering plants on which they fed.\nMany insects undergo metamorphosis during their develop\n-\nment. In the incomplete metamorphosis of grasshoppers \nand some other insect groups, the young (called nymphs) \nresemble adults but are smaller, have different body propor\n-\ntions, and lack wings. The nymph undergoes a series of molts, \neach time looking more like an adult. With the final molt, the \ninsect reaches full size, acquires wings, and becomes sexually \nmature. Insects with complete m...\n\nicals are then \nsecreted from the base of the podium, attaching it to the substrate. To \ndetach the tube foot, de-adhesive chemicals are secreted and muscles \nin the podium contract, forcing water back into the ampulla and \nshortening the podium. As it moves, a sea star leaves an observable \n“footprint” of adhesive material on the substrate.\nRadial canal. The water vascular system consists of a \nring canal in the central disk and five radial canals, each \nrunning in a groove down the entire length of an arm. \nBranching from each radial canal are hundreds of \nhollow, muscular tube feet filled with fluid. \nDigestive glands secrete \ndigestive juices and aid in the \nabsorption and storage\nof nutrients.\nMadreporite.

        "content": "keep in mind how \nnatural selection has produced plant forms that fit plant func-\ntion at all levels of structure. We begin by discussing plant \norgans because their structures are most familiar.\nVascular Plant Organs:  \nRoots, Stems, and Leaves\nEVOLUTION\n  The basic morphology, or shape, of vascular \nplants reflects their evolutionary history as terrestrial organ-\nisms that inhabit and draw resources from two very different \nenvironments—below the ground and above the ground. \nThey must absorb water and minerals from below the ground \nsurface and \nCO\n2\n and light from above the ground surface. The \nability to acquire these resources efficiently is traceable to the \nevolution of roots, stems, and leaves as the three basic organs. \nThese organs form a root system and a shoot system, the \nlatter consisting of stems and leaves \n(Figure 35.2). Vascular \nplants, with few exceptions, rely on both systems for survival. \nRoots are almost never photosynthetic; they starve unless \nphotosynthates...\n\nkened. Young stems \nand petioles often have strands of collenchyma cells just below their epidermis. Collenchyma \ncells provide flexible support without restraining growth. At maturity, these cells are living \nand flexible, elongating with the stems and leaves they support—unlike sclerenchyma cells, \nwhich we discuss next.\nSclerenchyma cells also function as supporting elements in the \nplant but are much more rigid than collenchyma cells. In scleren-\nchyma cells, the secondary cell wall, produced after cell elonga-\ntion has ceased, is thick and contains large amounts of lignin, a \nrelatively indigestible strengthening polymer that accounts for \nmore than a quarter of the dry mass of wood. Lignin is present in \nall vascular plants but not in bryophytes. Mature sclerenchyma \ncells cannot elongate, and they occur in regions of the plant that \nhave stopped growing in length.

Because there is a marked \ncontrast between the large cells of the new early wood and the \nsmaller cells of the late wood of the previous growing season, a \nyear’s growth appears as a distinct growth ring in cross sections of \nmost tree trunks and roots. Therefore, researchers can estimate a \ntree’s age by counting growth rings. Dendrochronology is the sci\n-\nence of analyzing tree growth ring patterns. Growth rings vary \nin thickness, depending on seasonal growth. Trees grow well \nin wet and warm years but may grow hardly at all in cold or dry \nyears. Since a thick ring indicates a warm year and a thin ring \nindicates a cold or dry one, scientists use ring patterns to study \nclimate changes \n(Figure 35.21).\nAs a tree or woody shrub ages, older layers of secondary \nxylem no longer transport water and minerals (a solution \nT...\n\nHox genes called KNOTTED-1, but unlike its counterparts \nin the animal world, KNOTTED-1 does not affect the number or \nplacement of plant organs.

KNOTTED-1 is, however, important in the development \nof leaf shape, including the production of compound leaves.

Moving to uncultivated \nareas, they observed the same pattern of reduced yields over \ntime. Eventually, they realized that fertilization, the addi\n-\ntion of mineral nutrients to the soil, could make soil a renew-\nable resource that enabled crops to be cultivated season after \nseason at a fixed location. This sedentary agriculture facili-\ntated a new way of life. Humans began to build permanent \ndwellings—the first villages. They also stored food for use \nbetween harvests, and food surpluses enabled some people to \nspecialize in nonfarming occupations. In short, soil manage\n-\nment, by fertilization and other practices, helped prepare the \nway for modern societies.\nUnfortunately, soil misman...\n\nation—the addition of salts to the soil that make it \ntoo salty for cultivating plants.

When a plant becomes dormant at the end of a \ngrowing season, there is a reduction in auxin transport capac\n-\nity and the expression of genes encoding auxin transporters.\nAuxin’s effects on plant development are not limited to \nthe familiar sporophyte plant that we see. Recent evidence \nsuggests that the organization of the microscopic angiosperm \nfemale gametophytes is regulated by an auxin gradient.\nPractical Uses for Auxins     Auxins, both natural and syn-\nthetic, have many commercial applications.

Because sunlight includes \nboth red and far-red radiation, during the day the \nP\nr\n4\n \nP\nfr\n \ninterconversion reaches a dynamic equilibrium, with the \nratio of the two phytochrome forms indicating the relative \namounts of red and far-red light. This sensing mechanism \nenables plants to adapt to changes in light conditions. \nConside...\n\nawn on the third day, and \nso on. Shut off from environmental cues, the plant becomes \ndesynchronized. Desynchronization happens to humans \nwhen we fly across several time zones; when we reach our \ndestination, the clocks on the wall are not synchronized \nwith our internal clocks. Most organisms are probably prone \nto jet lag.\nThe factor that entrains the biological clock to precisely \n24 hours every day is light. Both phytochromes and blue-\nlight photoreceptors can entrain circadian rhythms in plants, \nbut our understanding of how phytochromes do this is more \ncomplete. The mechanism involves turning cellular responses \non and off by means of the \nP\nr\n4P\nfr\n switch.\nConsider again the photoreversible system in Figure 39.17. \nIn darkness, the phytochrome ratio shifts gradually in favor \nof the \nP\nr\n form, partly as a result of turnover in the overall \nphytochrome pool.

For example, lima bean \n(Phaseolus lunatus) plants infested with spider mites release a \ncocktail of chemicals that signal “news” of the attack to \nnoninfested lima bean plants. In response, these neighbors \ninstigate biochemical changes that make them less susceptible \nto attack.

How would you use this ecosystem to \nfurther test the camouflage hypothesis?\nFor suggested answers, see Appendix A.\nCONCEPT \n1.4\nScience benefits from  \na cooperative approach  \nand diverse viewpoints\nMovies and cartoons sometimes portray scientists as loners \nin white lab coats, working in isolated labs. In reality, sci-\nence is an intensely social activity. Most scientists work in \nteams, which often include both graduate and undergradu-\nate students. And to succeed in science, it helps to be a good \ncommunicator. Research results have no impact until shared \nwith a community of peers through seminars, publications, \nand websites. And, in fact, research papers aren’t published \nuntil they are vetted by colleagues in what is called the “peer \nreview” process. The examples of scientific inquiry described \nin this book, for instance, have all been published in peer-\nreviewed journals.\nBuilding on the Work of Others\nThe great scientist Isaac Newton once said: “To explain all \nnature is too difficult a task for any one man or even for any \none age. ’Tis much better to do a little with certainty, and \nleave the rest for others that come after you.” Anyone who \nbecomes a scientist, driven by curiosity about how nature \nworks, is sure to benefit greatly from the rich storehouse of \ndiscoveries by others who have come before.

The goal of \nscience is to understand natural phenomena, while that \nof technology is to apply scientific knowledge for some \nspecific purpose. Because scientists put new technology \nto work in their research, science and technology are \ninterdependent.\nThe potent combination of science and technology can \nhave dramatic effects on society. Sometimes, the applications \nof basic research that turn out to be the most beneficial come \nout of the blue, from completely unanticipated observations \nin the course of scientific exploration. For example, discovery \nof the structure of DNA by Watson and Crick in 1953 and sub\n-\nsequent achievements in DNA science led to the technologies \nof DNA manipulation that are transforming applied fields \nnative inhabitants of Africa and other warm regions and their \ndescendants.

D. W. Kaufman hypoth­\nesized that the extent to which the coat color of a mouse con­\ntrasted with the color of its surroundings would affect the rate \nof nighttime predation by owls. He also hypothesized that the \ncontrast would be affected by the amount of moonlight. In this \nexercise, you will analyze data from his studies of owl predation \non mice that tested these hypotheses.\nHow the Experiment Was Done  Pairs of mice (Peromyscus \npolionotus) with different coat colors, one light brown and one \ndark brown, were released simultaneously into an enclosure \nthat contained a hungry owl. The researcher recorded the color \nof the mouse that was first caught by the owl. If the owl did not \ncatch either mouse within 15 minutes, the test was recorded as \na zero. The release trials were repeated multiple times in enclo­\nsures with either a dark­colored soil surface or a light­colored soil \nsurface. The presence or absence of moonlight during each assay \nwas recorded.\nData from the Experiment",

How is this accomplished?\nIn whales and most other animals, the evolutionary adap\n-\ntations that enable sufficient exchange with the environ-\nment are specialized surfaces that are extensively branched \nor folded \n(Figure 40.4). In almost all cases, these exchange \nsurfaces lie within the body, an arrangement that protects \ntheir delicate tissues from abrasion or dehydration and allows \nfor streamlined body contours.

In fact, regulated changes in the \ninternal environment are essential to normal body functions. \nSome regulated changes occur during a particular stage in life, \nsuch as the radical shift in hormone balance that occurs dur\n-\ning puberty. Other regulated changes are cyclic, such as the \nvariation in hormone levels responsible for a woman’s men-\nstrual cycle (see Figure 46.14).\nIn all animals (and plants), certain cyclic alterations in \nmetabolism reflect a circadian rhythm, a set of physiologi\n-\ncal changes that occur roughly every 24 hours \n(Figure 40.9). \nOne way to observe this rhythm is to monitor body tem-\nperature, which in humans typically undergoes a cyclic rise \nand fall of more than 0.6°C (1°F) in every 24-hour period. \nRemarkably, a biological clock maintains this rhythm even \nwhen variations in human activity, room temperature, and \nlight levels are minimized (see Figure 40.9a). A circadian \nrhythm is thus intrinsic to the body, although the biological \nbelow 20°C, the the...\n\nm\n-\nperature. In a cold environment, an endotherm generates \nenough heat to keep its body substantially warmer than its \nsurroundings \n(Figure 40.11a). In a hot environment, endo-\nthermic vertebrates have mechanisms for cooling their bod-\nies, enabling them to withstand temperatures that are intoler-\nable for most ectotherms.\nMany ectotherms adjust their body temperature \nby behavioral means, such as seeking out shade or bask\n-\ning in the sun \n(Figure 40.11b). Because their heat source \nis largely environmental, ectotherms generally need to \nconsume much less food than endotherms of equiva\n-\nlent size—an advantage if food supplies are limited. \nEctotherms also usually tolerate larger fluctuations in \ntheir internal temperature.\nCONCEPT \n40.3\n(a) King penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus), endotherms\n(b) Florida red-bellied turtles (Pseudemys nelsoni ), ectotherms\n.

BMR is measured \nunder a “comfortable” temperature range—a range that \nrequires only the minimum generation or shedding of heat. \nThe minimum metabolic rate of ectotherms is determined \nat a specific temperature because changes in the environ\n-\nmental temperature alter body temperature and therefore \nmetabolic rate. The metabolic rate of a fasting, nonstressed \nbody growth and repair, synthesis of storage material such \nas fat, and production of gametes. The production and use of \nATP generate heat, which the animal eventually gives off to \nits surroundings \n(Figure 40.18).\nQuantifying Energy Use\nHow much of the total energy an ani-\nmal obtains from food does it need just \nto stay alive? How much energy must \nbe expended to walk, run, swim, or fly \nfrom one place to another? What fraction \nof the energy intake is used for reproduc\n-\nt...\n\nthrough vessels (right). (See Figure 35.10 and Figure 42.9.)\nThe exchange of certain \ngases with the environment \nis essential for life. \nRespiration by plants and \nanimals requires taking up \noxygen (O\n2\n) and releasing carbon dioxide (CO\n2\n). In photosynthesis, \nnet exchange occurs in the opposite direction: CO\n2\n uptake and O\n2\n \nrelease. In both plants and animals, highly convoluted surfaces \nthat increase the area available for gas exchange have evolved, \nsuch as the spongy mesophyll of leaves (left) and the alveoli of \nlungs (right).

The overall flow and transformation of \nenergy in an animal—its bioenergetics—determines \nnutritional needs and is related to the animal’s size, activ\n-\nity, and environment.\nEnergy Allocation and Use\nOrganisms can be classified by how they obtain chemical \nenergy. Most autotrophs, such as plants, harness light energy \nto build energy-rich organic molecules and then use those \nmolecules for fuel. Most heterotrophs, such as animals, obtain \ntheir chemical energy from food, which contains organic \nmolecules synthesized by other organisms.\nAnimals use chemical energy harvested from the food they \neat to fuel metabolism and activity. Food is digested by enzy\n-\nmatic hydrolysis (see Figure 5.2b), and nutrients are absorbed \nby body cells. The ATP (adenosine triphosphate) produced by \ncellular respiration and fermentation powers cellular work, \nenabling cells, organs, and organ systems to perform the \nfunctions that keep an animal alive. Other uses of energy in \nthe form of ATP include biosynthesis, which is needed for \nBlood vessels in skin \ndilate; capillaries fill \nwith warm blood; heat \nradiates from skin surface.\nThermostat in \nhypothalamus \nactivates cooling \nmechanisms.\nSweat glands \nsecrete \nsweat, which \nevaporates, \ncooling the \nbody.\nThermostat in \nhypothalamus \nactivates warming \nmechanisms.\nBlood vessels in skin \nconstrict, diverting blood \nfrom skin to deeper \ntissues and reducing heat \nloss from skin surface.\nSkeletal muscles rapidly \ncontract, causing shivering, \nwhich generates heat.\nBody temperature increases\n(such as when exercising or\nin hot surroundings).\nBody temperature decreases\n(such as when in cold\nsurroundings).\nBody temperature\ndecreases.\nBody temperature\nincreases.\nNORMAL BODY TEMPERATURE\n(approximately 36–38°C)\nc Figure 40.17 The thermostatic \nfunction of the hypothalamus in \nhuman thermoregulation.\nWHAT IF?

A kilocalorie equals 1,000 calories, or \n4,184 joules. (The unit Calorie, with a capital C, as used by \nmany nutritionists, is actually a kilocalorie.)\nMetabolic rate can be determined in several ways. \nBecause nearly all of the chemical energy used in cellular respi\n-\nration eventually appears as heat, metabolic rate can be mea-\nsured by monitoring an animal’s rate of heat loss. For this \napproach, researchers use a calorimeter, which is a closed, \ninsulated chamber equipped with a device that records the \nheat an animal gives off to its environment. Metabolic rate \ncan also be determined from the amount of oxygen consumed \nor carbon dioxide produced by an animal’s  cellular respira\n-\ntion \n(Figure 40.19). To calculate metabolic rate over longer \nperiods, researchers record the rate of food  consumption, \nthe energy content of the food (about 4.5–5 kcal per gram of \nprotein or carbohydrate and about 9 kcal per gram of fat), and \nthe chemical energy lost in waste products (feces and urine or \nother nitrogenous wastes).\nMinimum Metabolic Rate  \nand Thermoregulation\nAnimals must maintain a minimum metabolic rate for basic \nfunctions such as cell maintenance, breathing, and circula-\ntion. Researchers measure this minimum metabolic rate \ndifferently for endotherms and ectotherms. The minimum \nm",

For example, the printing press, which \nhelped spread knowledge to all social classes, was invented \nby the German Johannes Gutenberg around 1440. This \ninvention relied on several innovations from China, includ\n-\ning paper and ink. Paper traveled along trade routes from \nChina to Baghdad, where technology was developed for its \nmass production. This technology then migrated to Europe, \nas did water-based ink from China, which was modified \nby Gutenberg to become oil-based ink. We have the cross- \nfertilization of diverse cultures to thank for the printing press, \nand the same can be said for other important inventions.\nAlong similar lines, science benefits from a diversity \nof backgrounds and viewpoints among its practitioners. \nBut just how diverse a population are scientists in relation \nto gender, race, ethnicity, and other attributes?\nThe scientific community reflects the cultural standards \nand behaviors of the society around it. It is therefore not sur\n-\nprising that until recently, women, people of color, and other \nunderrepresented groups have faced huge obstacles in their \npursuit to become professional scientists in many countries \naround the world. Over the past 50 years, changing attitudes \nabout career choices have increased the proportion of women \nin biology and some other sciences, so that now women \nconstitute roughly half of undergraduate biology majors and \nbiology Ph.D. students.\nThe pace has been slow at higher levels in the profession, \nhowever, and women and many racial and ethnic groups \nare still significantly underrepresented in many branches of \nscience and technology. This lack of diversity hampers the \nprogress of science. The more voices that are heard at the \ntable, the more robust, valuable, and productive the scientific \ninterchange will be. The authors of this text welcome all stu\n-\ndents to the community of biologists, wishing you the joys \nand satisfactions of this exciting field of science.\nsuch as medicine, agriculture, and forensics \n(Figure 1.26). \nPerhaps Watson and Crick envisioned"

In an approach called reductionism, complex systems are \nbroken down to simpler components that are more manageable \nto study. In systems biology, scientists attempt to model the \ndynamic behavior of whole biological systems by studying the \ninteractions among the system’s parts.\n• Structure and function are correlated at all levels of biological \norganization. The cell, an organism’s basic unit of structure and \nfunction, is the lowest level that can perform all activities required \nfor life. Cells are either prokaryotic or eukaryotic. Eukaryotic \ncells have a DNA-containing nucleus and other membrane- \nenclosed organelles. Prokaryotic cells lack such organelles.\nInformation Theme: Life’s Processes Involve the \nExpression and Transmission of Genetic Information",

Such an arrangement is char\n-\nacteristic of certain invertebrates, including cnidarians and \nflatworms. Animals that lack a simple body plan display an \nalternative adaptation for efficient exchange: a circulatory \nsystem. Such systems move fluid between each cell’s immedi\n-\nate surroundings and the body tissues. As a result, exchange \nwith the environment and exchange with body tissues both \noccur over very short distances.\nIn most animals, the circulatory system is functionally \nlinked to the exchange of gases with the environment and with \nbody cells. For this reason, we’ll discuss systems for circulation \nand gas exchange together in this chapter. By considering \nexamples of these systems from a range of species, we’ll explore \ntheir common elements as well as their extensive variation.\nGastrovascular Cavities\nLet’s begin by looking at some animals whose body shapes put \nmany of their cel...\n\nies \ncarry blood away from the heart toward capillaries, and veins \nreturn blood toward the heart from capillaries.

Blood \nflow continues to the skin, which acts as the sole site of \ngas exchange while the frog is submerged.\n• In the three-chambered heart of turtles, snakes, and liz\n-\nards, an incomplete septum pa...\n\nvein\nRight atrium\nInferior\nvena cava\nAorta\n1\n10\n11\n3\n6\n3\n4\n7\n8\n9\n5\nRight ventricle\n2\n.

However, the total volume of blood in the systemic \ncircuit is much greater than that in the pulmonary circuit.\nVISUAL SKILLS \nIf you trace the path of a molecule of carbon dioxide \nthat starts in an arteriole in the right thumb and leaves the body in \nexhaled air, what is the minimum number of capillary beds the molecule \nencounters?

The AV valves are anchored by strong fibers \nthat prevent the...\n\nri\n-\noles to completely relieve pressure in the arteries, the heart \ncontracts again. Because the arteries remain pressurized \nthroughout the cardiac cycle (see Figure 42.10), blood con\n-\ntinuously flows into arterioles and capillaries.\nRegulation of Blood Pressure\nHomeostatic mechanisms regulate arterial blood pressure \nby altering the diameter of arterioles.

When the faucet is turned on, water \nflows at the same velocity at each point along the hose. What \nhappens when a narrow nozzle is attached to the end of the \nhose? Because water doesn’t compress under pressure, the vol\n-\nume of water moving through the nozzle in a given time must \nbe the ...\n\nblood and interstitial fluid takes place across the \nthin endothelial walls of the capillaries. How does exchange \noccur? A few macromolecules are carried across the endo\n-\nthelium in vesicles that form on one side by endocytosis and \nrelease their contents on the opposite side by exocytosis. \nSmall molecules, such as \nO\n2\n and CO\n2\n, simply diffuse across \nthe endothelial cells or, in some tissues, through microscopic \npores in the capillary wall. These openings also provide the \nroute for transport of small solutes such as sugars, salts, and \nurea, as well as for bulk flow of fluid into tissues driven by \nblood pressure within the capillary.\nTwo opposing forces control the movement of fluid between \nthe capillaries and the surrounding tissues: Blood pressure tends \nto drive fluid out of the capillaries, and the presence of blood \nproteins tends to pull fluid back \n(Figure 42.14). Many blood pro-\nteins (and all blood cells) are too large to pass readily through the \nvenules and veins ...\n\nduced by recombinant DNA technology is \nused to treat disorders such as anemia, a condition of lower-\nthan-normal erythrocyte or hemoglobin level that decreases \nthe oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. Some athletes \ninject themselves with EPO to increase their erythrocyte \nlevel. Because this practice is banned by most major sports \norganizations, runners, cyclists, and other athletes caught \nusing EPO-related drugs have forfeited their records and been \nbanned from future competitions.\nBlood Clotting\nWhen blood vessels are broken by an injury such as a small \ncut or scrape, a chain of events ensues that quickly seals the \n1\n23\nClotting factors from:\nPlatelets\nDamaged cells\nPlasma (factors include calcium, vitamin K)\nProthrombinThrombin\nEnzymatic cascade\nFibrinogen\nPlatelet\nPlatelet\nplug\nRed blood cells caught\nin threads of fibrin\nFibrin clot\nCollagen fibers\nFibrin \n5 \nom\nThe clotting process begins when the \nendothelium of a vessel is damaged, \nexposing connective tissue in the \nv...\n\nDiversity in the structure of gills, external body surfaces that  \nfunction in gas exchange.\nURRY8743_12_SE_C42_PRF.indd   94011/6/19   1:13 PM\n\n CHAPTER 42   Circulation and Gas Exchange 941\na gill capillary, it encounters water that is completing its pas-\nsage through the gill. Depleted of much of its dissolved \nO\n2\n,  \nthis water nevertheless has a higher \nP\nO\n2\n than the incoming \nblood, and \nO\n2\n transfer takes place. As the blood continues its \npassage, its \nP\nO\n2\n steadily increases, but so does that of the water \nit encounters, since each successive position in the blood’s \ntravel corresponds to an earlier position in the water’s pas\n-\nsage over the gills. The result is a partial pressure gradient that \nfavors the diffusion of \nO\n2\n from water to blood along the entire \nlength of the capillary.\nCountercurrent exchange mechanisms are remarkably \nefficient. In the fish gill, more than 80% of the \nO\n2\n dissolved in \nthe water is removed as the water passes over the respiratory \nsu...\n\nbs \nand diaphragm. Air enters through the nostrils and is then \nfiltered by hairs, warmed, humidified, and sampled for \nodors as it flows through a maze of spaces in the nasal cav\n-\nity. The nasal cavity leads to the pharynx, an intersection \nwhere the paths for air and food cross \n(Figure 42.24). When \nfood is swallowed, the larynx (the upper part of the respi-\nratory tract) moves upward and tips the epiglottis over the \nglottis, which is the opening of the trachea, or windpipe. \nThis allows food to go down the esophagus to the stomach \n(see Figure 41.9). The rest of the time, the glottis is open, \nenabling breathing.\nFrom the larynx, air passes into the trachea. The cartilage \nthat reinforces the walls of both the larynx and the trachea \nkeeps this part of the airway open. Within the larynx of most \nmammals, the exhaled air rushes by a pair of elastic bands of \nmuscle called vocal folds or, in humans, vocal cords.

Like the polished \nsurface of a copper pipe, the smooth \nendothelial layer minimizes resis\n-\ntance to fluid flow. Surrounding the \nendothelium are tissue layers that \ndiffer among capillaries, arteries, \nand veins, reflecting distinct adap\n-\ntations to the particular functions of \nthese vessels \n(Figure 42.9).\nCapillaries are the smallest \nblood vessels, having a diameter \nonly slightly greater than that of a \nred blood cell. Capillaries also have \nvery thin walls, which consist of just \nan endothelium and a surrounding \nextracellular layer called the basal \n \nlamina. The exchange of substances  \nbetween the blood and interstitial fluid  \noccurs only in capillaries because only  \nthere are the vessel walls thin enough to  \npermit this exchange.\nIn contrast to capillaries, both arteries and veins have \nwalls that consist of two layers of tissue surrounding the \nendothelium. The outer layer is formed by connective tissue \n \nURRY8743_12_SE_C42_PRF.indd   92911/6/19   1:13 PM\n\n930 UNIT SEVEN   Animal Form and Function\nof the arteries. You can feel this pulse—the rhythmic bulging \nof the artery walls with each heartbeat—by placing the tips of \nyour fingers on the inside of the opposite wrist. The pressure \nsurge is partly due to the narrow openings of arterioles imped\n-\ning the exit of blood from the arteries. When the heart con-\ntracts, blood enters the arteries faster than it can leave, and the \nvessels stretch to a wider diameter from the rise in pressure.\nDuring diastole, the elastic walls of the arteries snap \nback. As a consequence, there is a lower but still substantial \nblood pressure when the ventricles are relaxed (diastolic \npressure). Before enough blood has flowed into the arte",

As illustrated in \nFigure 43.10b \nfor antibodies, they can bind to antigens on the surface of \npathogens or free in body fluids.\nAntigen Recognition by T Cells\nFor a T cell, the antigen receptor consists of two different \npolypeptide chains, an a chain and a b chain, linked by a \ndisulfide bridge \n(Figure 43.11). Near the base of the T cell \nantigen receptor (often called simply a T cell receptor) is a \ntransmembrane region that anchors the molecule in the cell’s \nplasma membrane. At the outer tip of the molecule, the vari\n-\nable (V) regions of the \na and b chains together form a single \nantigen-binding site. The remainder of the molecule is made \nup of the constant (C) regions....\n\nencountered previously, due to a feature known as \nimmunological memory, which we’ll explore later in the chapter.\nReceptor diversity and self-tolerance arise as a lym\n-\nphocyte matures. Cell proliferation and the formation of \nimmunological memory occur later, after a mature lympho-\ncyte encounters and binds to a specific antigen. We’ll con-\nsider these four characteristics in the order in which they \ndevelop.\nThe Basis of B Cell and T Cell Diversity\nEach person makes more than 1 million different B cell anti-\ngen receptors and 10 million different T cell antigen recep-\ntors. Yet there are only about 20,000 protein-coding genes \nin the human genome. How, then, do we generate so many \ndifferent antigen receptors? The answer lies in combinations. \nThink of selecting a cell phone model that comes in three \nsizes and six colors. There are 18 (\n3*6) combinations to con-\nsider.

The defenses provided by B and T \nlymphocytes can be divided into humoral and cell-mediated \nimmune responses. The humoral immune response pro\n-\ntects the blood and lymph (once called body humors, or flu-\nids). In this response, antibodies help neutralize or eliminate \ntoxins and pathogens in body fluids. In the cell-mediated \nimmune response, specialized T cells destroy infected host \ncells. Both humoral and cellular immunity can include a pri\n-\nmary and a secondary immune response, with memory cells \nenabling the secondary response.\nHelper T Cells: Activating Adaptive \nImmunity\nA type of T cell called a helper T cell activates humoral and \ncell-mediated immune responses. Before this can happen, \nhowever, two conditions must be met. First, a foreign mol\n-\necule must be present that can bind specifically to the antigen \nreceptor of the helper T cell. Second, this antigen must be \ndisplayed on the surface of an antigen-presenting cell. An \nantigen-presenting cell can be a dendritic cell, macrophage, \nor B cell.\nLike immune cells, infected cells can display foreign \nantigens on their surface. What then distinguishes antigen-\npresenting cells from infected cells? The answer lies in two \ndistinct types, or classes, of MHC molecules. Most body cells \nhave only the class I MHC molecules, but antigen-presenting \ncells have both class I and class II MHC molecules. The class \nII molecules provide a molecular signature by which an \n antigen-presenting cell is recognized.\nA helper T cell and the antigen-presenting cell display\n-\ning its specific epitope have a complex interaction. The \nantigen receptors on the surface of the helper T cell bind \nto the antigen fragment and to the class II MHC molecule \ndisplaying that fragment on the antigen-presenting cell \n(Figure 43.18). At the same time, an accessory protein called \nCD4 on the helper T cell surface binds to the class II MHC \nmolecule, helping keep the cells joined. As the two cells \ninteract, signals are exchanged in the form of cytokines. \nFor example, the cytokines secreted from a dendritic cell \nact in combination with the antigen to stimulate the helper \nT cell, causing it to produce its own set of cytokines. Also, \nextensive contact between the cell surfaces enables further \ninformation exchange.\nCONCEPT \n43.3\ndecades.

When \ntwo solutions differ in osmolarity, the solution with the higher \nconcentration of solutes is said to be hyperosmotic, and the more \ndilute solution is said to be hypoosmotic. Water flows by osmo\n-\nsis from a hypoosmotic solution to a hyperosmotic one, thus \nreducing the concentration difference for both solutes and free \nwater (see the diagram on the first page of the chapter).\nIn this chapter, we use the terms isoosmotic, hypoosmotic, \nand hyperosmotic, which refer specifically to osmolarity, \ninstead of isotonic, hypotonic, and hypertonic. The latter set of \nterms applies to the response of animal cells—whether they \nswell or shrink—in solutions of known solute concentrations.\nURRY8743_12_SE_C44_PRF.indd   97808/11/19   9:03 PM\n\n CHAPTER 44   Osmoregulation and Excretion 979\nof freshwater animals must be hyperosmotic because \nanimal cells cannot tolerate salt concentrati...\n\ne, certain salts, vitamins, \nhormones, and amino acids—are reabsorbed by active trans\n-\nport. Nonessential solutes and wastes are left in the filtrate \nor are added to it by selective secretion, which also occurs \nby active transport. The pumping of various solutes in turn \ndetermines whether water moves by osmosis into or out of \nthe filtrate. In the last step—excretion—the processed filtrate \ncontaining nitrogenous wastes is released from the body as a \nfluid waste called urine.\nSurvey of Excretory Systems\nThe systems that perform the basic excretory functions outlined \nin Figure 44.8 vary widely among animal groups. However, \nthey are generally built on a complex network of tubules that \nprovide a large surface area for the exchange of water and sol\n-\nutes, including nitrogenous wastes. We’ll examine the excre-\ntory systems of flatworms, earthworms, insects, and vertebrates \nas examples of evolutionary variations on tubule networks.\nProtonephridia\nAs illustrated in Figure 44.9, flat...\n\nsecrete ammonia, which acts as a \nbuffer to trap \nH\n+\n in the form of ammonium ions (NH\n4\n+\n). \nThe more acidic the filtrate is, the more ammonia the cells \nproduce and secrete, and a mammal’s urine usually contains \nsome ammonia from this source (even though most nitrog\n-\nenous waste is excreted as urea). The proximal tubules also \nreabsorb about 90% of the buffer bicarbonate (\nHCO\n3\n-\n) from \nthe filtrate, contributing further to pH balance in body fluids.\nAs the filtrate passes through the proximal tubule, materi\n-\nals to be excreted become concentrated. Many wastes leave \nthe body fluids during the nonselective filtration process and \nremain in the filtrate while water and salts are reabsorbed. \nUrea, for example, is reabsorbed at a much lower rate than \nare salt and water. In addition, some materials are actively \nsecreted into the filtrate from surrounding tissues. For exam\n-\nple, drugs and toxins that have been processed in the liver \npass from the peritubular capillaries into t...\n\nituitary and generate thirst. Water reabsorption \nin the collecting duct and water intake restore normal blood osmolarity, inhibiting further \nADH secretion.\n Mastering Biology  Animation: Control of Water Reabsorption\nURRY8743_12_SE_C44_PRF.indd   99408/11/19   9:03 PM\n\n CHAPTER 44   Osmoregulation and Excretion 995\nrelease of ADH from the posterior pituitary.

Eggs develop in the ovaries and then travel through \nthe oviducts to the uterus.

There is evidence that bulbo-\nurethral fluid carries some sperm released before ejaculation, \nwhich may contribute to the high failure rate of the with-\ndrawal method of birth control (coitus interruptus).\nPenis\nThe human penis contains the urethra as well as three cylin-\nders of spongy erectile tissue. During sexual arousal, the erectile \ntissue fills with blood from the arteries. As this tissue fills, the \nincreasing pressure seals off the veins that drain the penis, caus\n-\ning it to engorge with blood. The resulting erection enables the \npenis to be inserted into the vagina. Alcohol consumption, cer-\ntain drugs, emotional issues, and aging all can cause an inabil-\nity to achieve an erection (erectile dysfunction). For individuals \nwith long-term erectile dysfunction, drugs such as Viagra pro-\nmote the vasodilating action of ...\n\nsurrounding a central \ncavity. A few days later, the embryo implants into the endo\n-\nmetrium of the uterus. The condition of carrying one or more \nembryos in the uterus is called pregnancy, or gestation. \nHuman pregnancy averages 266 days (38 weeks) from \nfertilization of the egg, or 40 weeks from the start of the last men\n-\nstrual cycle.

For example, the mass number of sodium (\n23\n11\nNa) is \n23, but its atomic mass is 22.9898 daltons; the difference is \nexplained below.\nThe neutron and proton are almost identical in mass, each \nabout \n1.7*10\n-24\n gram (g). Grams and other conventional \nunits are not very useful for describing the mass of objects \nthat are so minuscule. Thus, for atoms and subatomic par\n-\nticles (and for molecules, too), we use a unit of measurement \ncalled the dalton, in honor of John Dalton, the British sci-\nentist who helped develop atomic theory around 1800. (The \ndalton is the same as the atomic mass unit, or amu, a unit you \nmay have encountered elsewhere.) Neutrons and protons \nhave masses close to 1 dalton. Because the mass of an elec\n-\ntron is only about 1/2,000 that of a neutron or proton, we \ncan ignore electrons when computing the total mass of an \natom.\nAtomic Number and Atomic Mass\nAtoms of the various elements differ in their number of sub-\natomic particles. All atoms of a particular element have the \nsame number of protons in their nuclei. This number of pro-\ntons, which is unique to that element, is called the atomic \nnumber and is written as a subscript to the left of the symbol \nfor the element. The abbreviation \n2\nHe, for example, tells \nus that an atom of the element helium has 2 protons in its \nnucleus. Unless otherwise indicated, an atom is neutral in \nelectrical charge, which means that its protons must be bal\n-\nanced by an equal number of electrons. Therefore, the atomic \nnumber tells us the number of protons and also the number \nof electrons in an electrically neutral atom.\nWe can deduce the number of neutrons from a second \nquantity, the mass number, which is the total number of \nprotons and neutrons in the nucleus of an atom. The mass \nnumber is written as a superscript to the left of an element’s \nsymbol. For example, we can use this shorthand to write an \natom of helium as \n4\n2\nHe. Because the atomic number indicates \nhow many protons there are, we can determine the num-\nber of neutrons by subtracting the atomic number from the \nmass number. In our example, the helium atom \n4\n2\nHe has \n2 neutrons. For sodium (Na):\n  Mastering Biology  Animation: Atomic Number and  \nAtomic Mass\nIsotopes\nAll atoms of a given element have the same number of \nprotons, but some atoms have more neutrons than other \natoms of the same element and therefore have greater mass. \nThese different atomic forms of the same element are called \nisotopes of the element. In nature, an element may occur as \na mixture of its isotopes. As an example, the element carbon, \nwhich has the atomic number 6, has three naturally occurring \nisotopes. The most common isotope is carbon-12, \n12\n   6\nC, which \naccounts for about 99% of the carbon in nature. The isotope \n12\n   6\nC has 6 neutrons. Most of the remaining 1% of carbon \nconsists of atoms of the isotope \n13\n   6\nC, with 7 neutrons. A third, \neven rarer isotope, \n14\n   6\nC, has 8 neutrons. Notice that all three \nisotopes of carbon have 6 protons; otherwise, they would not \nbe carbon. Although the isotopes of an element have slightly \ndifferent masses, they behave identically in chemical reac\n-\ntions. (For an element with more than one naturally occur-\nring isotope, the atomic mass is an average of those isotopes, \nweighted by their abundance. Thus, carbon has an atomic \nmass of 12.01 daltons.)\nBoth \n12\nC and \n13\nC are stable isotopes, meaning that their \nnuclei do not have a tendency to lose subatomic particles, a \nprocess called decay. The isotope \n14\nC, however, is unstable, \nor radioactive. A radioactive isotope is one in which \nthe nucleus decays spontaneously, giving off particles and \nenergy. When the radioactive decay leads to a change in the \nnumber of protons, it transforms the atom to an atom of a \ndifferent element. For example, when a carbon-14 (\n14\nC) atom \ndecays, a neutron decays into a proton, transforming the \natom into a nitrogen (\n14\nN) atom. Radioactive isotop",

Following information process\n-\ning within the CNS, instructions then travel to muscles, \nglands, and endocrine cells along PNS neurons designated \nas efferent (from the Latin, meaning “to carry away”). Note \nthat most nerves are bundles of both afferent and efferent \nneurons.\nThe PNS has two efferent components: the motor sys\n-\ntem and the autonomic nervous system (see Figure 49.8). \nThe neurons of the motor system carry signals to skeletal \nmuscles.

An \nelectron having a certain amount of energy is something \nlike a ball on a staircase (see Figure 2.6a). The ball can have \ndifferent amounts of potential energy, depending on which \nstep it is on, but it cannot spend much time between the steps. \nSimilarly, an electron’s potential energy is determined by \nits energy level.

The elements are arranged in three rows, or \nperiods, corresponding to the number of electron shells in their \natoms. The left-to-right sequence of elements in each row cor\n-\nresponds to the sequential addition of electrons and protons. \n(See the complete periodic table at the back of the book.)\nHydrogen’s 1 electron and helium’s 2 electrons are located \nin the first shell. Electrons, like all matter, tend to exist in the \nlowest available state of potential energy. In an atom, this \nstate is in the first shell.

We’ll focus \non four basic functions common to sensory pathways: sensory \nreception, transduction, transmission, and perception.\nSensory Reception and Transduction\nA sensory pathway begins with sensory reception, the \ndetection of a stimulus by specialized sensory cells. Each \nsensory cell is either a neuron or a cell that regulates a neuron \n(Figure 50.3). Some sensory cells exist singly; others are col-\nlected in sensory organs, such as the star-shaped nose of the \nmole in Figure 50.1.\nThe term sensory receptor describes a sensory cell or \norgan, as well as the subcellular structure that detects stimuli. \nSome sensory receptors respond to stimuli from within the \nbody, such as blood pressure and body position. Other recep\n-\ntors detect stimuli from outside the body, such as heat, light, \npressure, or chemicals. Some of these recept...\n\nAn electromagnetic receptor detects a form of electro-\nmagnetic energy, such as light, electricity, and magnetism. \nFor instance, the platypus has electroreceptors on its bill \nwould feel each beat of your heart and be constantly aware of \nevery bit of clothing on your body. Furthermore, adaptation \nis essential for you to see, hear, and smell changes in external \nstimuli that vary widely in intensity.\nTypes of Sensory Receptors\nSensory receptors fall into five categories based on the nature \nof the stimuli they transduce: mechanoreceptors, chemo-\nreceptors, electromagnetic receptors, thermoreceptors, and \npain receptors.\nMechanoreceptors\nOur senses of hearing and balance, as well as our responses \nto pressure, touch, stretch, and motion, rely on sensory \nreceptors called mechanoreceptors, which sense physi\n-\ncal deformation caused by forms of mechanical energy. \nMechanoreceptors typically consist of ion channels that \nare linked to structures that extend outside the cell, such \nas “ha...\n\ndetermined \nby the amplitude, or height, of the sound wave. A large-\namplitude wave causes more vigorous vibration of the basilar \nmembrane, greater bending of the hairs on hair cells, and \nmore action potentials in the afferent neurons that transmit \ninformation to the brain. Pitch is determined by a sound \nwave’s frequency, the number of vibrations per unit time. The \ndetection of sound wave frequency takes place in the cochlea \nand relies on the asymmetric structure of that organ.\nThe cochlea can distinguish pitch because the basilar \nmembrane is not uniform along its length: It is relatively \nnarrow and stiff near the oval window and wider and more \nflexible at the apex at the base of the cochlea. Each region \nof the basilar membrane is tuned to a different vibration \nfrequency \n(Figure 50.12b). Furthermore, each region is con-\nnected by axons to a different location in the cerebral cortex. \nConsequently, when a sound wave causes vibration of a \nparticular region of the basilar mem...\n\nlight. \n(a)\n.

Like a \ncamera’s adjustable aperture, the iris expands or contracts, \nchanging the diamete...\n\nment.\nIn bright light, rhodopsin remains active, and the response \nin the rods becomes saturated. If the amount of light enter\n-\ning the eyes abruptly decreases, the rods do not regain full \nresponsiveness for several minutes. This is why you are briefly \nblinded if you pass quickly from bright sunshine into a dark \nmovie theater.

In addition, \nanimals such as ants and bees that live in large social groups \nrely extensively on chemical “conversation.”\nIn all animals, chemical senses are important for \nfeeding behavior. The perceptions of gustation (taste) \nand olfaction (smell) both depend on chemoreceptors. \nIn the case of terrestrial animals, taste is the detection of \nchemicals called tastants that are present in a solution, and \nsmell is the detection of odorants that are carried through \nthe air. There is no distinction between taste and smell in \naquatic animals.\nIn insects, taste receptors are located within sensory hairs \nlocated on the feet and in mouthparts, where they are used \nto select food. A tasting hair contains several chemorecep\n-\ntors, each especially responsive to a particular class of tastant, \nsuch as sugar or salt. Insects are also capable of smelling air-\nborne odorants using olfactory hairs, usually located on their \nantennae (see Figure 50.6). The chemical DEET (N,N-diethyl-\nmeta-toluamide), marketed as an insect “repellant,” actually \nprotects against bites by blocking the olfactory receptor in \nmosquitoes that detects human scent.\nExperiment  To investigate the basis of mammalian taste \nperception, researchers used a chemical called phenyl-\nb-d-\nglucopyranoside (PBDG). Humans find PBDG extremely bitter. \nMice, however, lack a receptor for PBDG. Mice avoid drinking \nwater containing other bitter tastants but show no aversion \nto water that contains PBDG.\nUsing a molecular cloning strategy, the researchers gener-\nated mice that made the human PBDG receptor in cells that \nnormally make either a sweet receptor or a bitter receptor. \nThe mice were given a choice of two bottles, one filled with \npure water and one filled with water containing PBDG at vary-\ning concentrations. The researchers then observed whether \nthe mice had an attraction or an aversion to PBDG.\nResults\nRelative consumption (%)\nConcentration of PB"

For \nexample, most terrestrial mammals are nocturnal, which \nmakes visual displays relatively ineffective. Instead, these \nspecies use olfactory and auditory signals, which work as well \nin the dark as in the light. In contrast, most birds are diurnal \n(active mainly in daytime) and communicate primarily by \nvisual and auditory signals. Humans are also diurnal and, like \nbirds, use primarily visual and auditory communication. We \ncan thus detect and appreciate the songs and bright colors \nused by birds to communicate but miss many chemical cues \non which other mammals base their behavior.\nThe information content of animal communication var\n-\nies considerably. One of the most remarkable examples is the \nsymbolic language of the European honeybee (Apis mellifera), \ndiscovered in the early 1900s by Austrian researc...\n\nose the arm with the \ndifferent pattern.\nThe maze experiments provide strong experimental sup\n-\nport for the hypothesis that honeybees can distinguish on \nthe basis of “same” and “different.” Remarkably, research \npublished in 2010 indicates that honeybees can also learn to \ndistinguish human faces.\nThe information-processing ability of a nervous system \ncan also be revealed in problem solving, the cognitive \n. Figure 51.9 Associative learning. Having ingested and \nvomited a monarch butterfly, a blue jay has probably learned to \navoid this species.\n Mastering Biology  HHMI Video: How Lizards Find \nTheir Way Home\nAssociative Learning\nLearning often involves making associations between experi-\nences. Consider, for example, a blue jay (Cyanocitta cristata) \nthat ingests a brightly colored monarch butterfly (Danaus \nplexippus). Substances that the monarch accumulates from \nmilkweed plants cause the blue jay to vomit almost imme\n-\ndiately \n(Figure 51.9). Following such experiences, blue \nja...\n\nmate \nchoice is a healthy male is likely to pro\n-\nduce more offspring that survive to re-\nproduce. As a result, males may compete with each other in \nritualized contests to attract female attention \n(Figure 51.16).  \nIn face-offs between male stalk-eyed flies, the male whose \neyestalk length is smaller usually retreats peacefully.\nMate choice can also be influenced by imprinting, as \nrevealed by experiments carried out with zebra finches \n(Taeniopygia guttata). Both male and female zebra finches \nnormally lack any feather crest on their head \n(Figure 51.17). \nTo explore whether parental appearance affects mate pref-\nerence in offspring independent of any genetic influence, \nresearchers provided zebra finches with artificial ornamen-\ntation. A 2.5-cm-long red feather was taped to the forehead \nfeathers of either or both zebra finch parents when their \nchicks were 8 days old, approximately 2 days before they \nopened their eyes. A control group of zebra finches was raised \nby unadorned pa...\n\nlook \nmore closely at some examples of unselfish behavior and con\n-\nsider how they might arise.\nIn discussing selflessness, we will use the term altruism \nto describe a behavior that reduces an animal’s individual \nfitness but increases the fitness of other individuals in the \npopulation. Consider, for example, the Belding’s ground \nsquirrel (Urocitellus beldingi), which lives in the western \nUnited States and is vulnerable to predators such as coyotes \nand hawks. A squirrel that sees a predator approach often \ngives a high-pitched alarm call that alerts unaware indi\n-\nviduals to retreat to their burrows. In warning others, how-\never, this squirrel brings attention to its location and thus \nincreases its own risk of being killed.\nAnother example of altruistic behavior occurs in honey\n-\nbee societies, in which the workers are sterile. The workers \nthemselves never reproduce, but they labor on behalf of a \nsingle fertile queen. Furthermore, the workers sting intruders, \na behavior that h...",

Atoms with incom\n-\nplete valence shells can interact with certain other atoms in \nsuch a way that each partner atom completes its valence shell: \nThe atoms either share or transfer valence electrons. These \ninteractions usually result in atoms staying close together, held \nby attractions called chemical bonds. The strongest kinds \nof chemical bonds are covalent bonds in molecules and ionic \nbonds in dry ionic compounds. (Ionic bonds in aqueous, or \nwater-based, solutions are weak interactions, as we will see later.)\nURRY8743_12_SE_C02_PRF.indd   3611/6/19   5:25 AM\n\n CHAPTER 2   The Chemical Context of Life 37\nelectrons are shared equally because the two atoms have the \nsame electronegativity—the tug-of-war is at a standoff. Such \na bond is called a nonpolar covalent bond. For example, \nthe single bond of \nH\n2\n is nonpolar, as is the double bond of O\n2\n. \nHowever, when an atom is bonded to a more electronegative \natom, the electrons of the bond are not shared equally. This \ntype of bond is called a polar covalent bond. Such bonds \nvary in their polarity, depending on the relative electronega\n-\ntivity of the two atoms. For example, the bonds between the \noxygen and hydrogen atoms of a water molecule are quite \npolar \n(Figure 2.11).\nOxygen is one of the most electronegative elements, \nattracting shared electrons much more strongly than hydro\n-\ngen does. In a covalent bond between oxygen and hydrogen, \nthe electrons spend more time near the oxygen nucleus than \nnear the hydrogen nucleus. Because electrons have a negative \ncharge and are pulled toward oxygen in a water molecule, \nthe oxygen atom has partial negative charges (indicated by \nthe Greek letter \nd with a minus sign, d-, or “delta minus”), \nand the hydrogen atoms have partial positive charges (\nd+, or \n“delta plus”). In contrast, the individual bonds of methane \n(\nCH\n4\n) are much less polar because the electronegativities of \ncarbon and hydrogen are quite similar.\nIonic Bonds\nIn some cases, two atoms are so unequal in their attraction for \nvalence electrons that the more electronegative atom strips \nan electron completely away from its partner. The two result\n-\ning oppositely charged atoms (or molecules) are called ions. \nA positively charged ion is called a cation, while a negatively \ncharged ion is called an anion. (It may help you to think of \nthe t in cation as a plus sign, and of anion as “a negative ion.”) \nBecause of their opposite charges, cations and anions attract \neach other; this attraction is called an ionic bond. Note that \nthe transfer of an electron is not, by itself, the formation of a \nbond; rather, it allows a bond to form because it results in two \nions of opposite charge. Any two ions of opposite charge can \nform an ionic bond. The ions do not need to have acquired \ntheir charge by an electron transfer with each other.\nThe molecules \nH\n2\n and O\n2\n are pure elements rather than \ncompounds because a compound is a combination of two or \nmore different elements.

Sea stars \ngroup together in tide pools, where food is readily available \nand where they can breed successfully \n(Figure 53.3a). The \naggregation of individuals into groups may also increase the \neffectiveness of predation or defense; for example, a wolf \npack is more likely than a single wolf to subdue a moose, and \na flock of birds is more likely than a single bird to warn of a \npotential attack.\nA uniform, or evenly spaced, pattern of dispersion \nmay result from direct interactions between individu\n-\nals in the population. Some plants secrete chemicals that \ninhibit the germination and growth of nearby individuals \nthat could compete for resources. Animals often exhibit \nuniform dispersion as a result of antagonistic social \n(a) Clumped. Sea stars group together where food is abundant.\n(b) Uniform. King penguins and other birds that nest on small \nislands often exhibit uniform spacing, maintained by \naggressi...\n\nhe time \ninterval \n∆t).

In fact, as \n∆t becomes shorter, \nr\n∆t\n and r become increasingly close to one another in value.\nExponential Growth\nEarlier we described a population whose members all have \naccess to abundant food and can reproduce at their physio-\nlogical capacity. In some cases, a population that experiences \nsuch ideal conditions increases in size by a constant propor-\ntion at each instant in time. When this occurs, the pattern \nof growth that results is called exponential population \ngrowth. The equation for exponential growth is the one \n presented at the end of the previous section, namely:\ndN\ndt\n=rN\nThe exponential model describes \npopulation growth in an idealized, \nunlimited environment\nPopulations of all species have the potential to expand greatly \nwhen resourc...\n\netween survival and repro\n-\nductive traits such as frequency of reproduction, number of \noffspring (number of seeds produced by plants; litter or clutch \nsize for animals), or investment in parental care. The traits \nthat affect an organism’s schedule of reproduction and sur\n-\nvival make up its life history. Life history traits of an organ-\nism are evolutionary outcomes reflected in its development, \nphysiology, and behavior.\nCONCEPT \n53.4\nDiversity of Life Histories\nWe’ll focus on three key components of an organism’s life his-\ntory: when reproduction begins (the age at first reproduction \nor age at maturity), how often the organism reproduces, and \nhow many offspring are produced per reproductive episode. \nThe fundamental idea that evolution accounts for the diver\n-\nsity of life is manifest in the broad range of these life history \ncharacteristics in nature. For example, the age at which repro-\nduction begins varies considerably across species. A typical log-\ngerhead turtle is about ...\n\ne density is low, \nthere are more births than \ndeaths.

Figure 53.15 Determining equilibrium for population \ndensity. \nIn this example, the birth rate changes with population \ndensity, while the death rate is constant; immigration and \nemigration rates are assumed to be equal. At the equilibrium density \n(Q), the birth and death rates are equal. As a result, the number of \nindividuals added to the population equals the number removed \nfrom it, and the population stops changing in size.\nDRAW IT \nRedraw this figure for the case where the birth and death \nrates are both density dependent, as occurs for many species.\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\n6040\nKelp perch density (number/plot)\nKelp perch\n201030500\n0\nKelp perch death rate (percentage of \nfish that died in a given time interval)\n.

The Sargasso Sea, a sub-\ntropical region of the Atlantic Ocean, has some of the clearest \nwater in the world because of its low phytoplankton density. \nNutrient enrichment experiments have revealed that the avail\n-\nability of the micronutrient iron limits primary production \nthere \n(Table 55.1). Windblown dust from land supplies most of \nthe iron to the oceans but is relatively scarce in the Sargasso Sea \nand certain other regions compared to the oceans as a whole.\nNPP \n(Figure 55.5). Estuaries and coral reefs also have very high \nNPP, but their contribution to the global total is smaller because \nthese ecosystems cover only about one-tenth the area covered \nby tropical rain forests. In contrast, while the open oceans are \nrelatively unproductive, their vast size means that together they \ncontribute as much global NPP as terrestrial sys...\n\nd waste products are \nreleased. When the organism dies, the atoms in its body are \nreturned to the atmosphere, water, or soil by decomposers. \nBy liberating nutrients from organic matter, decomposition \nreplenishes the pools of inorganic nutrients that plants and \nother autotrophs use to build new organic matter.\nDecomposition and Nutrient Cycling Rates\nDecomposers are heterotrophs that get their energy from detri-\ntus. Their growth is controlled by the same factors that limit pri-\nmary production in ecosystems, including temperature, mois-\nture, and nutrient availability. Decomposers usually grow faster \nand decompose material more quickly in warmer ecosystems \n(Figure 55.12). In tropical rain forests, most organic material \ndecomposes in a few months to a few years, whereas in temper-\nate forests, decomposition takes four to six years, on average. \nThe difference is largely the result of the higher temperatures \nand more abundant precipitation in tropical rain forests.\nCONCEPT \n55.4\n...\n\ner vapor. Freezing of soil water\ncan limit water availability to terrestrial plants.\nReservoirs  The oceans contain 97% of the water in the\nbiosphere. Approximately 2% is bound in glaciers and polar\nice caps, and the remaining 1% is in lakes, rivers, and\ngroundwater, with a negligible amount in the atmosphere.\nKey processes  The main processes driving the water\ncycle are evaporation of liquid water by solar energy,\ncondensation of water vapor into clouds, and precipitation.\nTranspiration by terrestrial plants also moves large volumes\nof water into the atmosphere.

Sometimes, however, that recovery takes centuries, \nparticularly when humans have degraded the environment. \nTropical areas that are cleared for farming may quickly \nbecome unproductive because of nutrient losses. Mining \nactivities may last for several decades, and the lands are often \nabandoned in a degraded state. Ecosystems can also be dam\n-\naged by salts that build up in soils from irrigation and by \ntoxic chemicals or oil spills. Biologists increasingly are called \non to help restore and repair damaged ecosystems.\nRestoration ecologists seek to initiate or speed up the \nrecovery of degraded ecosystems. One of the basic assump\n-\ntions is that environmental damage is at least partly revers-\nible. This optimistic view must be balanced by a second \nassumption—that ecosystems are not infinitely resilient. \nRestoration ecologists therefore work to identify and manip\n-\nulate the processes that most limit recovery of ecosystems \nCONCEPT \n55.5\nfrom disturbances. Where disturbance is so severe that restor-\ning all of a habitat is impractical, ecologists try to reclaim as \nmuch of a habitat or ecological process as possible, within \nthe limits of the time and money available to them.\nIn extreme cases, the physical structure of an ecosys\n-\ntem may need to be restored before biological restoration \ncan occur. If a stream was straightened to channel water \nquickly through a suburb, ecologists may reconstruct a \nmeandering channel to slow down the flow of water erod\n-\ning the stream bank. To restore an open-pit mine, engi-\nneers may grade the site with heavy equipment to reestab-\nlish a gentle slope, spreading topsoil when the slope is in \nplace \n(Figure 55.16).\nAfter any physical reconstruction of the ecosystem is com-\nplete, the next step is biological restoration. The long-term \nobjective of restoration is to return an ecosystem as closely \nas possible to its predisturbance state. \nFigure 55.17 explores \nfour ambitious and successful restoration projects. These and \nthe many other such projects throughout the world often \nemploy two key strategies: bioremediation and biological \naugmentation.\n Mastering Biology HHMI Video: Response of  \nCorals to Ocean Warming and Efforts to Restore  \nDamaged Reefs \nBioremediation\nUsing organisms—usually prokaryotes, fungi, or plants—to \ndetoxify polluted ecosystems is known as bioremediation. \nSome plants and lichens adapted to soils containing heavy met\n-\nals can accumulate high concentrations of toxic metals such as \nlead and cadmium in their tissues. Restoration ecologists can \nintroduce such species to sites polluted by mining and other \nhuman activities and then harvest these organisms to remove \nthe metals from the ecosystem. For instance, researchers in the \nUnited Kingdom have discovered a lichen species that grows \n(a) In 1991, before restoration(b) In 2010, several years after restoration \n.

While provid\n-\ning the benefits of hydroelectric power and increased ship \ntraffic, these dams and locks also helped drive more than  \n40 species of mussels and snails to extinction.\nIntroduced Species\nIntroduced species—sometimes called invasive, non-\nnative, or exotic species—are those that humans move \nintentionally or accidentally from the species’ native loca\n-\ntions to new geographic regions. Human travel by ship and \nairplane has accelerated the transplant of species. Free from \nthe predators, herbivores, pathogens, or competitors that \nlimit their populations in their native habitats, such trans\n-\nplanted species may spread rapidly through a new region.\n.

Which scenario would result in \na greater loss of genetic diversity if the Mediterranean popu-\nlation were harvested to extinction? Explain your answer.\nFor suggested answers, see Appendix A.\nCONCEPT \n56.2\nPopulation conservation focuses \non population size, genetic \ndiversity, and critical habitat\nBiologists who work on conservation at the population \nand species levels use two main approaches. One approach \nfocuses on populations that are small and hence often vulner\n-\nable, while the other emphasizes critical habitat.\nExtinction Risks in Small Populations\nSmall populations are particularly vulnerable to overhar-\nvesting, habitat loss, and the other threats to biodiversity \nthat you read about in Concept 56.1. After such factors have \nreduced a population’s size to a small number of individuals, \nthe small size itself can push the population to extinction.\nThe Extinction Vortex:...\n\nsex ratio) reduces \nN\ne\n. For instance, if the total popu-\nlation size is 1,000 but only 400 females and 400 males breed,  \nthen \nN\ne\n=14*400*4002>1400+4002=800, or 80% of \nthe total population size. Numerous factors can influence \nN\ne\n.  \nAs a result, alternative formulas for estimating \nN\ne\n have been \ndeveloped to account for factors such as age at maturation, \ngenetic relatedness among population members, the effects \nof gene flow, and population fluctuations.\nIn actual study populations, \nN\ne\n is always some fraction of the \ntotal population. Thus, simply determining the total number of \nindividuals in a small population does not necessarily provide \na good measure of whether the population is large enough to \navoid extinction. Whenever possible, conservation programs \nattempt to sustain total population sizes that include at least the \nminimum viable number of reproductively active individuals. The \nURRY8743_12_SE_C56_PRF.indd   126811/7/19   3:56 AM\n\n CHAPTER 56   Conservation B...\n\nynamics \nand economics as well.\nLandscape Structure and Biodiversity\nThe biodiversity of a given landscape is heavily influenced by \nits physical features, or structure. Understanding landscape \nstructure is critically important in conservation because \nmany species use more than one kind of ecosystem, and \nmany live on the borders between ecosystems.\nFragmentation and Edges\nThe boundaries, or edges, between ecosystems—such as \nbetween a lake and the surrounding forest or between crop-\nland and suburban housing tracts—are defining features of \nURRY8743_12_SE_C56_PRF.indd   127011/7/19   3:56 AM\n\n CHAPTER 56   Conservation Biology and Global Change  1271\nfound that species adapted to forest interiors show the greatest \ndeclines when patches are the smallest, suggesting that land-\nscapes dominated by small fragments will support fewer species.\nCorridors That Connect Habitat Fragments\nIn fragmented habitats, the presence of a movement corridor, \na narrow strip or series of small clumps of...\n\nvertebrates and plants, with less atten\n-\ntion paid to invertebrates and microorganisms. Some biolo-\ngists are also concerned that the  hot-spot strategy places too \nmuch emphasis on such a small fraction of Earth’s surface.\nClimate change makes the task of preserving hot spots \neven more challenging because the conditions that favor a \nparticular community may not occur there in the future. The \nbiodiversity hot spot in the southwest corner of Australia \n(see Figure 56.19) holds thousands of species of endemic \n(unique to that area) plants and many endemic vertebrates. \nResearchers recently concluded that between 5% and 25% of \nthe plant species they examined may become extinct by 2080 \nbecause the plants will be unable to tolerate the increased \ndryness predicted for this region.\nPhilosophy of Nature Reserves\nNature reserves are protected “islands” of biodiversity in a sea \nof habitat altered or degraded by human activity. An earlier \npolicy—that protected areas should be set aside t...\n\ne increase in the concentration of atmospheric \nCO\n2\n \nover the last 170 years concerns scientists because of its link to \nincreased global temperature. Much of the solar radiation that \nstrikes the planet is emitted toward space as infrared radiation \n(known informally as “heat radiation”). \nAlthough \nCO\n2\n, methane, water vapor, and \nother greenhouse gases in the atmosphere \nare transparent to visible light, they inter\n-\ncept and absorb much of the infrared radi-\nation that Earth emits, radiating most of \nit back toward Earth. This process, called \nthe greenhouse effect, retains some of \nthe solar heat \n(Figure 56.30). If it were not \nfor this greenhouse effect, the average air \ntemperature at Earth’s surface would be a \nfrigid \n-18°C (-0.4°F), and most life as we \nknow it could not exist.\nAs the concentrations of \nCO\n2\n and \nother greenhouse gases rise, more solar \nheat is retained, thereby increasing the \ntemperature of our planet. So far, Earth \nhas warmed by an average of \n0.9°C ...\n\nin tropical regions, \nthe growth and survival of some species of coral have declined \nas water temperatures have risen. Recently, Australia’s Great \nBarrier Reef had a catastrophic decline: The combined effects \nof two consecutive marine heat waves (one in 2016, another \nin 2017) killed so many corals that two-thirds of the reef was \nseverely degraded—so degraded that some scientists worry \nit may never recover. A key take-home message from these \nexamples is that a given effect of climate change may, in turn, \ncause a series of other biological changes. The exact nature of \nsuch cascading biological effects can be hard to predict, but it \nis clear that the more our planet warms, the more severely its \necosystems will be affected.\nModeling Climate Change\nAt the current rates that human activities are adding CO\n2\n and \nother greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, global models \npredict that Earth’s temperature will rise by an additional \n3°C\n \n(\n5°F\n) by the end of the 21st century. What d...\n\ns mini-\nmum viable population size.\n• Conserving species often requires resolving conflicts between the \nhabitat needs of endangered species and human demands.\n?\n Why is the minimum viable population size smaller for a genetically \ndiverse population than for a less genetically diverse population?\nLandscape and regional conservation help sustain \nbiodiversity \n(pp. 1270–1274)\n• \nThe structure of a landscape can strongly influence biodiversity. \nAs habitat fragmentation increases and edges become more ex-\ntensive, biodiversity tends to decrease. Movement corridors \ncan promote dispersal and help sustain populations.\n• Biodiversity hot spots are also hot spots of extinction and thus \nprime candidates for protection. Sustaining biodiversity in parks \nand reserves requires management to ensure that human activi-\nties in the surrounding landscape do not harm the protected \nhabitats. The zoned reserve model recognizes that conservation \nefforts often involve working in landscapes that are gr...",

As products accumulate, \ncollisions resulting in the reverse reaction become more fre\n-\nquent. Eventually, the forward and reverse reactions occur \nat the same rate, and the relative concentrations of products \nand reactants stop changing. The point at which the reactions \noffset one another exactly is called chemical equilibrium. \nThis is a dynamic equilibrium; reactions are still going on in \nboth directions, but with no net effect on the concentrations \nof reactants and products. Equilibrium does not mean that \nthe reactants and products are equal in concentration, but \nonly that their concentrations have stabilized at a particular \nratio. The reaction involving ammonia reaches equilibrium \nwhen ammonia decomposes as rapidly as it forms. In some \nchemical reactions, the equilibrium point may lie so far to the \nright that these reactions go essentially to completion; that is, \nvirtually all the reactants are converted to products.\nWe will return to the subject of chemical reactions after more \ndetailed study of the various types of molecules that are impor\n-\ntant to life. In the next chapter, we focus on water, the sub-\nstance in which all the chemical processes of organisms occur.\nThis reaction breaks the covalent bonds of \nH\n2\n and O\n2\n and \nforms the new bonds of \nH\n2\nO. When we write the equation for a \nchemical reaction, we use an arrow to indicate the conversion \nof the starting materials, called the reactants, to the resulting \nmaterials, or products. The coefficients indicate the number \nof molecules involved; for example, the coefficient 2 before the \nH\n2\n means that the reaction starts with two molecules of hydro-\ngen. Notice that all atoms of the reactants must be accounted \nfor in the products. Matter is conserved in a chemical reaction: \nReactions cannot create or destroy atoms but can only rear\n-\nrange (redistribute) the electrons among them.\nPhotosynthesis, which takes place within the cells of \ngreen plant tissues, is an important biological example of \nhow chemical reactions rearrange matter. Humans and other \nanimals ultimately depend on photosynthesis for food and \noxygen, and this process is at the foundation of life in almost \nall ecosystems.\nThe following summarizes photosynthesis:\n6 CO\n2\nCarbon dioxide\nC\n6\nH\n12\nO\n6\nGlucose\n6 H\n2\nO\nWater\n6 O\n2\nOxygen\nReactantsProducts\nSunlight\n++\nThe raw materials of photosynthesis are carbon dioxide \n(\nCO\n2\n) and water (H\n2\nO), which land plants absorb from the air \nand soil, respectively. Within the plant cells, sunlight powers \nthe conversion of these ingredients to a sugar called glucose \n(\nC\n6\nH\n12\nO\n6\n) and oxygen molecules (O\n2\n), a by-product that can \nbe seen when released by a water plant \n(Figure 2.17). Although \nphotosynthesis is actually a sequence of many chemical reac-\ntions, we still end up with the same number and types of \natoms that we had when we started. Matter has simply been \nrearranged, with an input of energy provided by sunlight.\nAll chemical reactions are theoretically reversible, with \nthe products of the forward reaction becoming the reactants \nfor the reverse reaction. For example, hydrogen and nitrogen \nmolecules can combine to form ammonia, but ammonia can \nalso decompose to regenerate hydrogen and nitrogen:\nBubbles of O\n2\nLeaf\nc Figure 2.17  \nPhotosynthesis: a solar-\npowered rearrangement of \nmatter.\n Elodea, a freshwater \nplant, produces sugar by \nrearranging the atoms of \ncarbon dioxide and water in \nthe chemical process known \nas photosynthesis, which is \npowered by sunlight. Much of \nthe sugar is then converted to \nother food molecules. Oxygen",

A compound contains two or more different elements \nin a fixed ratio. Oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen make up \napproximately 96% of living matter.\n?\n \nCompare an element and a compound.\nCONCEPT 2.2\nAn element’s properties depend on the structure of its \natoms \n(pp. 30–36)\n•   An atom, the smallest unit of an element, has the following \ncomponents:\n–\n–\nNucleus\nProtons\n (+ charge)\ndetermine element\nElectrons (– charge)\nform negative cloud\nand determine\nchemical behavior\nNeutrons (no charge)\ndetermine isotope\nAtom\n+\n+\n•   An electrically neutral atom has equal numbers of electrons \nand protons; the number of protons determines the atomic \nnumber. The atomic mass is measured in daltons and is \nroughly equal to the mass number, the sum of protons plus \nneutrons. Isotopes of an element differ from each other in \nneutron number and therefore mass. Unstable isotopes give off \nparticles and energy as radioactivity.\n• In an atom, electrons occupy specific electron shells; the electrons \nin a shell have a characteristic energy level. Electron distribution in \nshells determines the chemical behavior of an atom. An atom that \nhas an incomplete outer shell, the valence shell, is reactive.\n•   Electrons exist in orbitals, three-dimensional spaces with spe-\ncific shapes that are components of electron shells.\nDRAW IT Draw the electron distribution diagrams for neon (\n10\nNe) \nand argon (\n18\nAr). Use these diagrams to explain why these elements are \nchemically unreactive.\nCONCEPT 2.3\nThe formation and function of molecules and ionic \ncompounds depend on chemical bonding between \natoms \n(pp. 36–40)\n• Chemical bonds form when atoms interact and complete their \nvalence shells. Covalent bonds form when pairs of electrons are \nshared:\nH  1 H\n1\nSingle\ncovalent bond\nDouble\ncovalent bond\nH   H\n••\n•\n•\nO\n•\n•\n••\n•\n•\nO\n•\n•\nO\n•\n•\n•\n•\n••••\n••\nO\n••\n••\n•\n•\n• Molecules consist of two or more covalently bonded atoms. The \nattraction of an atom for the electrons of a covalent bond is its \nelectronegativity. If both atoms are the same, they have the \nsame electronegativity and share a nonpolar covalent bond. \nElectrons of a polar covalent bond are pulled closer to the more \nelectronegative atom, such as the oxygen in \nH\n2\nO.\n•   An ion forms when an atom or molecule gains or loses an elec-\ntron and becomes charged. An ionic bond is the attraction be-\ntween two oppositely charged ions:\nNa\nCl\nChloride ion\n(an anion)\nSodium ion\n(a cation)\nElectron\ntransfer\nforms ions\nChlorine atomSodium atom\nCl\n2\nNa\n1\n21\nClNa\nIonic bond\nNa\nCl\n•   Weak interactions reinforce the shapes of large molecules \nand help molecules adhere to each other. A hydrogen bond \nis an attraction between a hydrogen atom carrying a partial \npositive charge \n(d+) and an electronegative atom carrying a \npartial negative charge \n(d-).

Although the arrangement of molecules in a \nsample of liquid water is constantly changing, at any given \nmoment many of the molecules are linked by multiple hydro\n-\ngen bonds. These linkages make water more structured than \nmost other liquids. Collectively, the hydrogen bonds hold \nthe substance together, a phenomenon called cohesion.\nOne result of cohesion due to hydrogen bonding is high \nsurface tension, a measure of how difficult it is to stretch \nor break the surface of a liquid. At the air-water interface is an \nordered arrangement of water molecules, hydrogen-bonded to \none another and to the water below, but not to the air above. \nThis asymmetry gives water an unusually high surface ten\n-\nsion, making it behave as though it were coated with an invis-\nible film.

Atoms and molecules have kinetic energy because \nthey are always moving, although not necessarily in any \nparticular direction. The faster a molecule moves, the \ngreater its kinetic energy. The kinetic energy associated \nwith the random movement of atoms or molecules is called \nthermal energy. Thermal energy is related to temperature, \nbut they are not the same thing. Temperature represents \nthe average kinetic energy of the molecules in a body of mat\n-\nter, regardless of volume, whereas the thermal energy of \na body of matter reflects the total kinetic energy, and thus \ndepends on the matter’s volume. When water is heated in a \ncoffeemaker, the average speed of the molecules increases, \nand the thermometer records this as a rise in temperature of \nthe liquid. The total amount of thermal energy also increases \nin this case. Note, however, that although the pot of cof\n-\nfee has a much higher temperature than, say, the water in a \nswimming pool, the swimming pool contains more thermal \nenergy because of its much greater volume.\nWhenever two objects of different temperature are \nbrought together, thermal energy passes from the warmer \nto the cooler object until the two are the same temperature. \nMolecules in the cooler object speed up at the expense of \nthe thermal energy of the warmer object. An ice cube cools a \ndrink not by adding coldness to the liquid but by absorbing \nthermal energy from the liquid as the ice itself melts. Thermal \nenergy in transfer from one body of matter to another is \ndefined as heat.\nOne convenient unit of heat used in this book is the \ncalorie (cal). A calori",

Until fairly recently, scientists \nassumed that other physical requirements for life included \na moderate range of temperature, pH, atmospheric pressure, \nand salinity, as well as low levels of toxic chemicals. That \nview has changed with the discovery of organisms known as \nextremophiles, which flourish in hot, acidic sulfur springs, \naround hydrothermal vents deep in the ocean, and in soils with \nhigh levels of toxic metals. Why would astrobiologists study \nextremophiles? What does the existence of life in such extreme \nenvironments say about the possibility of life on other planets?\n10. \nSCIENTIFIC INQUIRY Design a controlled experiment to test the \nhypothesis that water acidification caused by acidic rain would \ninhibit the growth of Elodea, a freshwater plant (see Figure 2.17 ).\n11. \nWRITE ABOUT A THEME: ORGANIZATION Several \nemergent properties of water contribute to the suitability of the \nenvironment for life. In a short essay (100–150 words), describe \nhow the ability of water to function as a versatile solvent arises \nfrom the structure of water molecules.\n12. \nSYNTHESIZE YOUR KNOWLEDGE\nHow do cats drink? \nScientists using high-\nspeed video have \nshown that cats use an \ninteresting technique \nto drink aqueous \nsubstances like water \nand milk. Four times a \nsecond, the cat touches \nthe tip of its tongue to \nthe water and draws \na column of water up \ninto its mouth (as you \ncan see in the photo), \nwhich then shuts \nbefore gravity can pull \nthe water back down. Describe how the properties of water \nallow cats to drink in this fashion, including how water’s \nmolecular structure contributes to the process.\nFor selected answers, see Appendix A.\nof vaporization. The evaporative loss of the most energetic \nwater molecules cools a surface.\n•   Ice floats because it is less dense than liquid water. This property \nallows life to exist under the frozen surfaces of lakes and polar \nseas.\n•   Water is an unusually versatile solvent because its polar mol-\necules are attracted to ions and polar substances that can form \nhydrogen bonds. Hydrophilic substances have an affinity for \nwater; hydrophobic substances do not. Molarity, the number \nof moles of solute per liter of solution, is used as a measure of \nsolute concentration in solutions. A mole is a certain number \nof molecules of a substance. The mass of a mole of a substance in \ngrams is the same as the molecular mass in daltons.\n• The emergent properties of water support life on Earth and may \ncontribute to the potential for life to have evolved on other planets.\n?\n Describe how different",

Recall \nthat it is the valence electrons, those in the outermost shell, \nthat are available to form bonds with other atoms.\nThe Formation of Bonds with Carbon\nCarbon has 6 electrons, with 2 in the first electron shell and 4 \nin the second shell; thus, it has 4 valence electrons in a shell \nthat can hold up to 8 electrons. A carbon atom usually com\n-\npletes its valence shell by sharing its 4 electrons with other \natoms so that 8 electrons are present. Each pair of shared elec-\ntrons constitutes a covalent bond (see Figure 2.10d). In organic \nmolecules, carbon usually forms single or double covalent \nbonds. Each carbon atom acts as an intersection point from \nwhich a molecule can branch off in as many as four directions. \nThis enables carbon to form large, complex molecules.\nURR",

As indicated by \nthe name, each polynucleotide consists of monomers called \nnucleotides. A nucleotide, in general, is composed of three \nparts: a five-carbon sugar (a pentose), a nitrogen-containing \n(nitrogenous) base, and one to three phosphate groups \n(Figure 5.23b). The beginning monomer used to build a poly-\nnucleotide has three phosphate groups, but two are lost dur-\ning the polymerization process. The portion of a nucleotide \nwithout any phosphate groups is called a nucleoside.\nTo understand the structure of a single nucleotide, let’s \nfirst consider the nitrogenous bases \n(Figure 5.23c). Each \nnitrogenous base has one or two rings that include nitrogen \natoms. (They are called nitrogenous bases because the nitro\n-\ngen atoms tend to take up \nH\n+\n from solution, thus acting as \nbases.) There are two families of nitrogenous bases: pyrimi-\ndines and purines. A pyrimidine has one six-membered ring \nof carbon and nitrogen atoms. The members of the pyrimi-\ndine family are cytosine (C), thymine (T), and uracil (U). \nNucleic acids store, transmit, and \nhelp express hereditary information\nIf the primary structure of polypeptides determines a protein’s \nshape, what determines primary structure? The amino acid \nsequence of a polypeptide is programmed by a discrete unit of \ninheritance known as a gene. Genes consist of DNA, which \nbelongs to the class of compounds called nucleic acids. Nucleic \nacids are polymers made of monomers called nucleotides.\nThe Roles of Nucleic Acids\nThe two types of nucleic acids, deoxyribonucleic acid \n(DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA), enable living organ-\nisms to reproduce their complex components from one gen-\neration to the next. Unique among molecules, DNA provides \ndirections for its own replication. DNA also directs RNA \nsynthesis and, through RNA, controls protein synthesis; this \nentire process is called gene expression \n(Figure 5.22).\nDNA is the genetic material that organisms inherit from \ntheir parents. Each chromosome contains one long DNA \nmolecule, usually carrying several hundred or more genes. \nWhen a cell reproduces itself by dividing, its DNA molecules \nare copied and passed along from one generation of cells to \nthe next. The information that programs all the cell’s activi\n-\nties is encoded in the structure of the DNA. The DNA, how-\never, is not directly involved in running the operations of \nthe cell, any more than computer software by itself can read \nthe bar code on a box of cereal. Just as a scanner is needed to \nread a bar code, proteins are required to implement genetic \nprograms. The molecular hardware of the cell—the tools that \ncarry out biological functions—consists mostly of proteins. \nFor example, the oxygen carrier in red b",

In addition \nto confirming evidence for evolution from the study of fos\n-\nsils and characteristics of currently existing species, genomics \nhas helped us tease out relationships among different groups \nof organisms that had not been resolved by previous types of \nevidence, and thus infer evolutionary history.\nDNA and Proteins as Tape Measures  \nof Evolution\nEVOLUTION\n We are accustomed to thinking of shared \ntraits, such as hair and milk production in mammals, as evi-\ndence of shared ancestry. Because DNA carries heritable infor-\nmation in the form of genes, sequences of genes and their \nprotein products document the hereditary background of an \norganism. The linear sequences of nucleotides in DNA mol\n-\necules are passed from parents to offspring; these sequences \ndetermine the amino acid sequences of proteins. As a result, \nsiblings have greater similarity in their DNA and proteins \nthan do unrelated individuals of the same species.\nGiven our evolutionary view of life, we can extend this \nconcept of “molecular genealogy” to relationships between \nspecies: We would expect two species that appear to be closely \nrelated based on anatomical evidence (and possibly fossil \nevidence) to also share a greater proportion of their DNA and \nprotein sequences than do less closely related species. In fact, \nthat is the case. An example is the comparison of the \nb poly-\npeptide chain of human hemoglobin with the corresponding \nhemoglobin polypeptide in other vertebrates. In this chain of \n146 amino acids, humans and gorillas differ in just 1 amino \nacid, while humans and frogs, more distantly related, differ in \n67 amino acids. In the \nScientific Skills Exercise, you can apply \nthis sort of reasoning to additional species. And this conclu-\nsion holds true as well when comparing whole genomes: The \nhuman genome is 95–98% identical to that of the chimpan-\nzee, but only roughly 85% identical to that of the mouse, a \nmore distant evolutionary relative. Molecular biology has \nadded a new tape measure to the toolkit biologists use to \nassess evolutionary kinship.\nComparing genomic sequences has practical applica\n-\ntions as well. In the \nProblem-Solving Exercise, you can see  \nhow this type of genomic analysis can help you detect \nconsumer fraud.\nof the DNA molecule was described in 1953, and the linear \nsequence of nucleotide bases was understood to specify \nthe amino acid sequence of proteins, biologists sought to \n“decode” genes by learning their nucleotide sequences \n \n(often called “base sequences”).\nThe first chemical techniques for DNA sequencing, \nor determining the sequence of nucleotides along a \nDNA strand, one by one, were developed in the 1970s. \nResearchers began to study gene sequences, gene by gene, \nand the more they learned, the more questions they had: \nHow was expression of genes regulated? Genes and their \nprotein products clearly interacted with each other, but \nhow? What was the function, if any, of the DNA that is not \npart of genes? To fully understand the genetic function\n-\ning of a living organism, the entire sequence of the full \ncomplement of DNA, the organism’s genome, would be most \nenlightening. In spite of the apparent impracticality of this \nidea, in the late 1980s several prominent biologists put \nforth an audacious proposal to launch a project that would \nsequence the entire human genome—all 3 billion bases of it! \nThis endeavor began in 1990 and was effectively completed \nin the early 2000s.\nAn unplanned but profound side benefit of this project—\nthe Human Genome Project—was the rapid development of \nfaster and less expensive methods of sequencing.
