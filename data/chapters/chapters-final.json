The sequence of nucleotides along a gene is transcribed into mRNA, which is then translated into a linked series of protein building blocks called amino acids. Once completed, the amino acid chain forms a specific protein with a unique shape and function. The entire process by which the informa - tion in a gene directs the manufacture of a cellular ... torage. The key is the ability of many biological processes to self-regulate by a mechanism called feedback. In feedback regulation, the output or product of a process regulates that very process. The most com - mon form of regulation in living systems is negative feedback, a loop in which the response reduces the ini- tial stimulus. As seen in the example of insulin signaling (Figure 1.10), after a meal the level of the sugar glucose in your blood rises, which stimulates cells of the pancreas to secrete insulin. Insulin, in turn, causes body cells to take up glucose and liver cells to store it, thus decreas - ing the blood glucose level. This eliminates the stimulus for insulin secretion, shutting off the pathway. Thus, the output of the process (insulin) negatively regulates that process. Though less common than processes regulated by nega - tive feedback, there are also many biological processes regu- lated by positive feedback, in which an end product speeds up its own... that invisible ghosts are fooling with your desk lamp! Because science only deals with natural, testable explanations for natu - ral phenomena, it can neither support nor contradict the invisible ghost hypothesis, nor whether spirits or elves cause storms, rainbows, or illnesses. Such super - natural explanations are simply outside the bounds of science, as are religious matters, which are issues of per- sonal faith. Science and religion are not mutually exclu- sive or contradictory; they are simply concerned with different issues. The Flexibility of the Scientific Process The way that researchers answer questions about the natural and physical world is often idealized as the scientific method. However, very few scientific inquiries adhere rigidly to the sequence of steps that are typically used to describe this approach. For example, a scientist may start to design an experiment, but then backtrack after realizing that more preliminary observations are necessary. In... ut the book to walk through other examples of biological inquiry. The researchers built hundreds of models of mice and spray-painted them to resemble either beach or inland mice, Beach population Florida Inland population GULF OF MEXICO Beach mice live on sparsely vegetated sand dunes along the coast. The light tan, dappled fur on their backs causes them to blend into their surroundings, providing camouflage. Members of the same species living about 30 km inland have dark fur on their backs, camouflaging them against the dark ground of their habitat. Beach population Inland population .

The main product of fossil fuel combustion (for example, by cars) is CO 2 . Placing containers of algae near sources of CO 2 emission makes sense because the algae need CO 2 to carry out photosynthe- sis. The higher the CO 2 concentration, the higher will be the rate of algal photosynthesis.

Another difference between the viruses is that the influenza virus has an outer envelope and TMV does not. 2. The T2 phages were an excellent choice for use in the Hershey-Chase experiment because they consist of only DNA surrounded by a protein coat, and DNA and protein were the two candidates for macromolecules that carried genetic information. Hershey and Chase were able to radioactively label each type of molecule alone and follow it during separate infections of E. coli cells with T2. Only the DNA entered the bacte- rial cell during infection, and only labeled DNA showed up in some of the progeny phage. Hershey and Chase concluded that the DNA must carry the genetic infor- mation necessary for the phage to reprogram the cell and produce progeny phages. Concept Check 19.2",

Both the CRISPR-Cas system and miRNAs involve RNA molecules bound in a protein complex and acting as “homing devices” that enable the complex to bind a complementary sequence. However, miRNAs are involved in regulating gene expression (by affecting mRNAs) and the CRISPR- Cas system protects bacterial cells from foreign invaders—infecting phages. Thus the CRISPR-Cas system is more like an immune system than is the miRNA sys- tem. 3. Both the viral RNA polymerase and the RNA polymerase in Figure 17.10 synthesize an RNA molecule complementary to a template strand. However, the RNA polymerase in Figure 17.10 uses one of the strands of the DNA double helix as a template, whereas the viral RNA polymerase uses the RNA of the viral genome as a template. 4. HIV is called a retrovirus because it synthesizes DNA using its RNA genome as a template. This is the reverse (“retro”) of the usual DNA S RNA information flow. 5. There are many steps that could be interfered with: binding of the virus to the cell, reverse transcriptase function, integration into the host cell chromosome, genome synthesis (in this case, transcription of RNA from the integrated provirus), assembly of the virus inside the cell, and budding of the virus. (Many of these, if not all, are targets of actual medical strat- egies to block progress of the infection in HIV-infected people.) Concept Check 19.3",

The other amniote lineage is our own, the mammals. Today, there are about 6,400 known species of mammals on Earth. Derived Characters of Mammals Mammals are named for their distinctive mammary glands, which produce milk for offspring. All mammalian moth- ers nourish their young with milk, a balanced diet rich in fats, sugars, proteins, minerals, and vitamins. Hair, another mammalian character, and a fat layer under the skin pro - vide insulation that can conserve water and protect the body against extremes of heat or cold. Another mammalian adaptation for life on land is the kidney (see Figure 44.13), which is efficient at conserving water when removing wastes from the body. Some mammals, such as kangaroo rats, are so adept at conserving water that they can survive 5 The kangaroo rat’s thick, oily skin limits evaporative water loss. 1 A kangaroo rat rarely drinks: It obtains nearly all of the water it needs from catabolic pathways and from moisture in food. 4 2 The animal stays in"

Scientific Skills Exercise URRY8743_12_SE_C01_PRF.indd 2311/6/19 5:17 AM 24 CHAPTER 1 Evolution, the Themes of Biology, and Scientific Inquiry The Value of Diverse Viewpoints in Science Many of the technological innovations with the most pro- found impact on human society originated in settlements along trade routes, where a rich mix of different cultures ignited new ideas. For example, the printing press, which helped spread knowledge to all social classes, was invented by the German Johannes Gutenberg around 1440. This invention relied on several innovations from China, includ - ing paper and ink. Paper traveled along trade routes from China to Baghdad, where technology was developed for its mass production. This technology then migrated to Europe, as did water-based ink from China, which was modified by Gutenberg to become oil-based ink. We have the cross- fertilization of diverse cultures to thank for the printing press, and the same can be said for other important inventions. Along similar lines, science benefits from a diversity of backgrounds and viewpoints among its practitioners. But just how diverse a population are scientists in relation to gender, race, ethnicity, and other attributes? The scientific community reflects the cultural standards and behaviors of the society around it. It is therefore not sur - prising that until recently, women, people of color, and other underrepresented groups have faced huge obstacles in their pursuit to become professional scientists in many countries around the world. Over the past 50 years, changing attitudes about career choices have increased the proportion of women in biology and some other sciences, so that now women constitute roughly half of undergraduate biology majors and biology Ph.D. students. The pace has been slow at higher levels in the profession, however, and women and many racial and ethnic groups are still significantly underrepresented in many branches of science and technology. This lack of diversity hampers the progress of science. The more voices that are heard at the table, the more robust, valuable, and productive the scientific interchange will be. The authors of this text welcome all stu - dents to the community of biologists, wishing you the joys and satisfactions of this exciting field of science. such as medicine, agriculture, and forensics (Figure 1.26).

CONCEPT 2.3 The formation and function of molecules and ionic compounds depend on chemical bonding between atoms Now that we have looked at the structure of atoms, we can move up the hierarchy of organization and see how atoms combine to form molecules and ionic compounds. Atoms with incom - plete valence shells can interact with certain other atoms in such a way that each partner atom completes its valence shell: The atoms either share or transfer valence electrons. These interactions usually result in atoms staying close together, held by attractions called chemical bonds. The strongest kinds of chemical bonds are covalent bonds in molecules and ionic bonds in dry ionic compounds. (Ionic bonds in aqueous, or water-based, solutions are weak interactions, as we will see later.) URRY8743_12_SE_C02_PRF.indd 3611/6/19 5:25 AM CHAPTER 2 The Chemical Context of Life 37 electrons are shared equally because the two atoms have the same electronegativity—the tug-of-war is at a standoff. Such a bond is called a nonpolar covalent bond. For example, the single bond of H 2 is nonpolar, as is the double bond of O 2 . However, when an atom is bonded to a more electronegative atom, the electrons of the bond are not shared equally. This type of bond is called a polar covalent bond. Such bonds vary in their polarity, depending on the relative electronega - tivity of the two atoms. For example, the bonds between the oxygen and hydrogen atoms of a water molecule are quite polar (Figure 2.11). Oxygen is one of the most electronegative elements, attracting shared electrons much more strongly than hydro - gen does. In a covalent bond between oxygen and hydrogen, the electrons spend more time near the oxygen nucleus than near the hydrogen nucleus. Because electrons have a negative charge and are pulled toward oxygen in a water molecule, the oxygen atom has partial negative charges (indicated by the Greek letter d with a minus sign, d-, or “delta minus”), and the hydrogen atoms have partial positive charges ( d+, or “delta plus”). In contrast, the individual bonds of methane ( CH 4 ) are much less polar because the electronegativities of carbon and hydrogen are quite similar. Ionic Bonds In some cases, two atoms are so unequal in their attraction for valence electrons that the more electronegative atom strips an electron completely away from its partner. The two result - ing oppositely charged atoms (or molecules) are called ions. A positively charged ion is called a cation, while a negatively charged ion is called an anion. (It may help you to think of the t in cation as a plus sign, and of anion as “a negative ion.”) Because of their opposite charges, cations and anions attract each other; this attraction is called an ionic bond. Note that the transfer of an electron is not, by itself, the formation of a bond; rather, it allows a bond to form because it results in two ions of opposite charge. Any two ions of opposite charge can form an ionic bond. The ions do not need to have acquired their charge by an electron transfer with each other. The molecules H 2 and O 2 are pure elements rather than compounds because a compound is a combination of two or more different elements. Water, with t",

BLOOD SALT WATER CHLORIDE CELL K + K + Na + Na + Cl – Flagellar motor H + Filament of flagellum Hook H 2 O Stoma H 2 O H 2 O H 2 O K 1 H 2 O Guard cells K 1 H 1 H 1 The transport of ions across the plasma membrane of a cell is a fundamental activity of all animals, and indeed of all living things. By generating ion gradients, ion transport provides the potential energy that powers processes ranging from an organism’s regulation of salts and gases in internal fluids to its perception of and locomotion through its environment. In marine bony fishes, ion gr adients drive secretion of salt (NaCl), a process es sential to avoid dehydration. Within gills, the pumps, cotransporters, and channels of specialized chloride cells function together to drive salt from the blood across the gill epithelium and into the surrounding salt water. (See Figure 44.3.) Ion gr adients provide the basis for the opening of a plant stoma by surrounding guard cells. Active transport of H + out of a guard cell generates a voltage (membrane potential) that drives inward movement of K + . This uptake of K + b y guard cells triggers an osmotic influx of water that changes cell shape, bowing the guard cells outward and thereby opening the stoma. (See Concept 36.4.) In neurons, tr ansmission of information as nerve impulses is made possible by the opening and closing of channels selective for sodium or other ions. These signals enable nervous systems to receive and process input and to direct appropriate output, such as this leap of a frog capturing prey. (See Concept 48.3 and Concept 50.5.) A gr adient of H + powers the bacterial flagellum. An electron tr ansport chain generates this gr adient, establishing a higher concentration of H + outside the bacterial cell. Protons reentering the cell provide a force that causes the flagellar motor to rotate. The rotating motor turns the curved hook, causing the attached filament to propel the cell.

A compound is made of atoms joined by bonds. Formic acid (CH 2 O 2 ) consists of carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and oxygen (O). The number of protons ( ) determines an atom’s identity. Oxygen has 8 protons. An atom’s electron ( ) distribution determines its ability to form bonds. Oxygen has space for 2 more electrons, so it can form 2 bonds. In formic acid, this O attracts H’s electron, releasing H + and making this compound an acid, which stings.

Start by measuring the scale bar and the diameter of each cell. The units you use are ir- relevant, but working in millimeters is convenient. Divide each diameter by the length of the scale bar and then multiply by the scale bar’s length value to give you the diameter in micrometers."

The evolutionary relationships between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells will be discussed later in this chapter, and prokaryotic cells will be described in detail elsewhere (see Chapter 27). Most of the discussion of cell structure that follows in this chapter applies to eukaryotic cells. A Panoramic View of the Eukaryotic Cell In addition to the plasma membrane at its outer surface, a eukaryotic cell has extensive, elaborately arranged internal membranes that divide the cell into compartments—the organelles mentioned earlier. The cell’s compartments pro - vide different local environments that support specific meta- bolic functions, so incompatible processes can occur simulta- neously in a single cell.

WRITE ABOUT A THEME: ORGANIZATION Write a short essay (100–150 words) on this topic: Life is an emergent property that appears at the level of the cell. (See Concept 1.1.) 10. SYNTHESIZE YOUR KNOWLEDGE Cell ComponentStructureFunction CONCEPT 6.5 Mitochondria and chloroplasts change energy from one form to another (pp. 109–112) ? What does the endosymbiont theory propose as the origin for mitochondria and chloroplasts? Explain. Mitochondrion Bounded by double membrane; inner membrane has infoldings Cellular respiration Chloroplast Typically two membranes around fluid stroma, which contains thyla- koids stacked into grana Photosynthesis (chloroplasts are present in cells of photosynthetic eukaryotes, including plants) Peroxisome Specialized metabolic com- partment bounded by a single membrane Contains enzymes that transfer H atoms from substrates to oxygen, producing H 2 O 2 (hydrogen perox- ide), which is converted to H 2 O CONCEPT 6.6 The cytoskeleton is a network of fibers that organizes structures and activities in the cell (pp. 112–117) • The cytoskeleton functions in structural support for the cell and in motility and signal transmission. • Microtubules shape the cell, guide organelle movement, and sep- arate chromosomes in dividing cells. Cilia and flagella are motile appendages containing microtubules. Primary cilia also play sen- sory and signaling roles. Microfilaments are thin rods that func- tion in muscle contraction, amoeboid movement, cytoplasmic streaming, and support of microvilli. Intermediate filaments support cell shape and fix organelles in place. ? Describe the role of motor proteins inside the eukaryotic cell and in whole-cell movement. CONCEPT 6.7 Extracellular components and connections between cells help coordinate cellular activities (pp. 118–121) • Plant cell walls are made of cellulose fibers embedded in other polysaccharides and proteins. • Animal cells secrete glycoproteins and proteoglycans that form the extracellular matrix (ECM), which functions in support, adhesion, movement, and regulation. • Cell junctions connect neighboring cells. Plants have plasmodesmata that pass through adjoining cell walls. Animal cells have tight junctions, desmosomes, and gap junctions. ?

Explain why this might be the case. (Hint: What processes in both living and dead trees produce CO 2 ?) 9. EVOLUTION CONNECTION Photorespiration can decrease soybeans’ photosynthetic output by about 50%. Would this figure be higher or lower in wild relatives of soybeans? Why? 10. SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY • DRAW IT The following diagram represents an experiment with isolated thylakoids. The thylakoids were first made acidic by soaking them in a solution at pH 4. After the thylakoid space reached pH 4, the thylakoids were transferred to a basic solution at pH 8. The thylakoids then made ATP in the dark. (See Concept 3.3 to review pH.) pH 7 pH 4 pH 4 pH 8 ATP Draw an enlargement of part of the thylakoid membrane in the beaker with the solution at pH 8. Draw ATP synthase. Label the areas of high H + concentration and low H + concentration. Show the direction protons flow through the enzyme, and show the reaction where ATP is synthesized. Would ATP end up in the thylakoid or outside of it? Explain why the thylakoids in the experiment were able to make ATP in the dark. 11.

These algae are also found in high-altitude, year-round snowfields. In both locations, UV light levels tend to be high. Propose an explanation for why this alga appears reddish-pink.

SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY Epinephrine initiates a signal transduction pathway that produces cyclic AMP (cAMP) and leads to the breakdown of glycogen to glucose, a major energy source for cells. But glycogen breakdown is only part of the fight-or-flight response that epinephrine brings about; the overall effect on the body includes an increase in heart rate and alertness, as well as a burst of energy. Given that caffeine blocks the activity of cAMP phosphodiesterase, propose a mechanism by which caffeine ingestion leads to heightened alertness and sleeplessness. 11. SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, AND SOCIETY The aging process is thought to be initiated at the cellular level. Among the changes that can occur after a certain number of cell divisions is the loss of a cell’s ability to respond to growth factors and other signals. Much research into aging is aimed at understanding such losses, with the ultimate goal of extending the human life span. Not everyone, however, agrees that this is a desirable goal. If life expectancy were greatly increased, discuss what might be the social and ecological consequences. 12. WRITE ABOUT A THEME: ORGANIZATION The properties of life emerge at the biological level of the cell. The highly regulated process of apoptosis is not simply the destruction of a cell; it is also an emergent property. Write a short essay (about 100–150 words) that briefly explains the role of apoptosis in the development and proper functioning of an animal, and describe how this form of programmed cell death is a process that emerges from the orderly integration of signaling pathways. 13. SYNTHESIZE YOUR KNOWLEDGE There are five basic tastes—sour, salty, sweet, bitter, and “umami.” Salt is detected when the concentration of salt outside of a taste bud cell is higher than that inside of it, and ion channels allow the passive leakage of Na + into the cell. The resulting change in membrane potential (see Concept 7.4) sends the “salty” signal to the brain. Umami is a savory taste generated by glutamate (glutamic acid, found in monosodium glutamate, or MSG), which is used as a flavor enhancer in foods such as taco-flavored tortilla chips. The glutamate receptor is a GPCR, which, when bound, initiates a signaling pathway that ends with a cellular response, perceived by you as “taste.” If you eat a regular potato chip and then rinse your mouth, you will no longer taste salt. But if you eat a flavored tortilla chip and then rinse, the taste persists. (Try it!) Propose a possible explanation for this difference. For selected answers, see Appendix A.

However, evolution does not work this way; instead, it operates on the traits an organism already has. Thus, in birds and bats, an existing pair of limbs took on new functions for flight as these organisms evolved from nonflying ancestors.",

A seal spends part of its time on rocks; it could probably walk better if it had legs instead of flippers, but then it would not swim nearly as well. We humans owe much of our versatility and athleti - cism to our prehensile hands and flexible limbs, but these also make us prone to sprains, torn ligaments, and dislo- cations: Structural reinforcement has been compromised for agility. Organisms face many such trade-offs in which the ability to perform one function may reduce the abil - ity to perform another—and as with seals and humans, those trade-offs can restrict adaptive evolution. heterozygotes, not enough become sickled to cause sickle- cell disease. As described in Figure 23.18, heterozygotes for the sickle-cell allele are protected against the most severe effects of malaria, a disease caused by a parasite that infects red blood cells. One reason for this partial protection is that the body destroys sickled red blood cells rapidly, killing the parasites they harbor. Malaria is a major killer in some tropical regions. In such regions, selec - tion favors heterozygotes over homozygous dominant individu- als, who are more vulnerable to the effects of malaria, and also over homozygous recessive individuals, who develop sickle-cell disease. These selective pressures have caused the frequency of the sickle-cell allele to reach relatively high levels in areas where the malaria parasite, which is carried by mosquitoes, is common.

Figure 36.12 Ascent of xylem sap. Hydrogen bonding forms an unbroken chain of water molecules extending from leaves to the soil. The force driving the ascent of xylem sap is a gradient of water potential ( Ψ). For bulk flow over long distance, the Ψ gradient is due mainly to a gradient of the pressure potential ( Ψ P ). Transpiration results in the Ψ P at the leaf end of the xylem being lower than the Ψ P at the root end. The Ψ values shown at the left are a “snapshot.” They may vary during daylight, but the direction of the Ψ gradient remains the same.

For me, role models were important. At that time, I knew about only two professions that blacks were in: medicine and teaching. There was one black physician in town—unusual for a rural town. My high school principal—he was black—would tell us, “By golly, you could be anything you want to be!” I paid attention and listened. He helped me ap- ply to Knoxville College, and I decided I would be a physician, so I majored in biol- ogy and minored in chemistry. Then, in my senior year, my professor at Knoxville—he was interested in diversity—got me into a research program at the University of Tennessee, which was not integrated at that time—blacks couldn’t attend.

Instructors: A version of this Scientific Skills Exercise can be assigned in Mastering Biology. It takes work to move a given electron farther away from the nucleus, so the more distant an electron is from the nucleus, the greater its potential energy. Unlike the continu - ous flow of water downhill, changes in the potential energy of electrons can occur only in steps of fixed amounts. An electron having a certain amount of energy is something like a ball on a staircase (see Figure 2.6a). The ball can have different amounts of potential energy, depending on which step it is on, but it cannot spend much time between the steps. Similarly, an electron’s potential energy is determined by its energy level. An electron can exist only at certain energy levels, not between them. URRY8743_12_SE_C02_PRF.indd 3311/6/19 5:25 AM 34 UNIT ONE The Chemistry of Life Electron Distribution and Chemical Properties The chemical behavior of an atom is determined by the dis- tribution of electrons in the atom’s electron shells. Beginning with hydrogen, the simplest atom, we can imagine build - ing the atoms of the other elements by adding 1 proton and 1 electron at a time (along with an appropriate number of neutrons). Figure 2.7, a modified version of what is called the periodic table of the elements, shows this distribution of electrons for the first 18 elements, from hydrogen ( 1 H) to argon ( 18 Ar). The elements are arranged in three rows, or periods, corresponding to the number of electron shells in their atoms. The left-to-right sequence of elements in each row cor - responds to the sequential addition of electrons and protons. (See the complete periodic table at the back of the book.) Hydrogen’s 1 electron and helium’s 2 electrons are located in the first shell. Electrons, like all matter, tend to exist in the lowest available state of potential energy. In an atom, this state is in the first shell. However, the first shell can hold no more than 2 electrons; thus, hydrogen and helium are the An electron’s energy level is correlated with its average distance from the nucleus. Electrons are found in different electron shells, each with a characteristic average distance and energy level. In diagrams, shells can be represented by concentric circles, as they are in Figure 2.6b. The first shell is closest to the nucleus, and electrons in this shell have the low - est potential energy. Electrons in the second shell have more energy, and electrons in the third shell even more energy. An ele"

SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY Using two neighboring ponds in a forest as your study site, design a controlled experiment to measure the effect of falling leaves on net primary production in a pond. 12. WRITE ABOUT A THEME: ENERGY AND MATTER Decomposition typically occurs quickly in moist tropical for- ests. However, waterlogging in the soil of some moist tropical forests results over time in a buildup of organic matter called “peat.” In a short essay (100–150 words), discuss the relation- ship of net primary production, net ecosystem production, and decomposition for such an ecosystem. Are NPP and NEP likely to be positive? What do you think would happen to NEP if a landowner drained the water from a tropical peatland, expos- ing the organic matter to air? 13. SYNTHESIZE YOUR KNOWLEDGE This dung beetle (genus Scarabaeus) is burying a ball of dung it has collected from a large mammalian herbivore in Kenya. Explain why this process is important for the cycling of nutrients and for primary production. For selected answers, see Appendix A.

MAKE CONNECTIONS What do climate change (see Concepts 1.1 and 3.2) and ocean acidification have in common? 9. EVOLUTION CONNECTION This chapter explains how the emergent properties of water contribute to the suitability of the environment for life. Until fairly recently, scientists assumed that other physical requirements for life included a moderate range of temperature, pH, atmospheric pressure, and salinity, as well as low levels of toxic chemicals. That view has changed with the discovery of organisms known as extremophiles, which flourish in hot, acidic sulfur springs, around hydrothermal vents deep in the ocean, and in soils with high levels of toxic metals. Why would astrobiologists study extremophiles? What does the existence of life in such extreme environments say about the possibility of life on other planets? 10. SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY Design a controlled experiment to test the hypothesis that water acidification caused by acidic rain would inhibit the growth of Elodea, a freshwater plant (see Figure 2.17 ). 11. WRITE ABOUT A THEME: ORGANIZATION Several emergent properties of water contribute to the suitability of the environment for life. In a short essay (100–150 words), describe how the ability of water to function as a versatile solvent arises from the structure of water molecules. 12. SYNTHESIZE YOUR KNOWLEDGE How do cats drink? Scientists using high- speed video have shown that cats use an interesting technique to drink aqueous substances like water and milk. Four times a second, the cat touches the tip of its tongue to the water and draws a column of water up into its mouth (as you can see in the photo), which then shuts before gravity can pull the water back down. Describe how the properties of water allow cats to drink in this fashion, including how water’s molecular structure contributes to the process. For selected answers, see Appendix A. of vaporization. The evaporative loss of the most energetic water molecules cools a surface. • Ice floats because it is less dense than liquid water. This property allows life to exist under the frozen surfaces of lakes and polar seas. • Water is an unusually versatile solvent because its polar mol- ecules are attracted to ions and polar substances that can form hydrogen bonds. Hydrophilic substances have an affinity for water; hydrophobic substances do not. Molarity, the number of moles of solute per liter of solution, is used as a measure of solute concentration in solutions. A mole is a certain number of molecules of a substance. The mass of a mole of a substance in grams is the same as the molecular mass in daltons. • The emergent properties of water support life on Earth and may contribute to the potential for life to have evolved on other planets. ?

Forms hydrogen bonds with water, helping dissolve compounds such as sugars. Compound name: Alcohol (specific name usually ends in -ol) Sugars with ketone groups are called ketoses; those with aldehydes are called aldoses. Compound name: Ketone (carbonyl group is within a carbon skeleton) or aldehyde (carbonyl group is at the end of a carbon skeleton) Acts as an acid (can donate H + ) because the covalent bond between oxygen and hydrogen is so polar. Compound name: Carboxylic acid, or organic acid Acts as a base; can pick up an H + from the surrounding solution (water, in living organisms). Compound name: Amine Two  SH groups can react, forming a cross-link that helps stabilize protein structure. Hair protein cross-links maintain the straightness or curliness of hair; in hair salons, permanent treatments break cross-links, then re-form them while the hair is in the desired shape. Compound name: Thiol Contributes negative charge (1 when positioned inside a chain of phosphates; 2 when at the end). When attached, confers on a molecule the ability to react with water, releasing energy. Compound name: Organic phosphate Affects the expression of genes when bonded to DNA or to proteins that bind to DNA. Affects the shape and function of male and female sex hormones.

CONCEPT 4.1 Organic chemistry is key to the origin of life (pp. 57–58) • Organic compounds, once thought to arise only within living organisms, were finally synthesized in the laboratory. • Living matter is made mostly of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen. Biological diversity results from carbon’s ability to form a huge number of molecules with particular shapes and properties. ? How did Stanley Miller’s experiments support the idea that, even at life’s origins, physical and chemical laws govern the processes of life? CONCEPT 4.2 atoms, forming the carbon skeletons of organic compounds. These skeletons vary in length and shape and have bonding sites for atoms of other elements. • Hydrocarbons consist of carbon and hydrogen. • Isomers are compounds that have the same molecular formula but different structures and therefore different properties. Three types of isomers are structural isomers, cis-trans isomers, and enantiomers. VISUAL SKILLS Refer back to Figure 4.9. What type of isomers are acetone and propanal? How many asymmetric carbons are present in acetic acid, glycine, and glycerol phosphate? Can these three molecules exist as forms that are enantiomers? CONCEPT 4.3 A few chemical groups are key to molecular function (pp. 62–64) • Chemical groups attached to the carbon skeletons of organic mol- ecules participate in chemical reactions (functional groups) or contribute to function by affecting molecular shape (see Figure 4.9). • ATP (adenosine triphosphate) consists of adenosine attached to three phosphate groups.

When a carbon atom has four single bonds to other atoms, the molecule is tetrahedral. (b) Ethane. A molecule may have more than one tetrahedral group of single-bonded atoms. (Ethane consists of two such groups.) (c) Ethene (ethylene). When two carbon atoms are joined by a double bond, all atoms attached to those carbons are in the same plane, and the molecule is flat.

The structural formula for CO 2 is shown here: O“C“O Each line in a structural formula represents a pair of shared electr... urine. Again, each atom has the required number of covalent bonds. In this case, one carbon atom participates in both single and double bonds. Urea and carbon dioxide are molecules with only one carbon atom.

Carbon skeletons vary in length and may be straight, branched, or arranged in closed rings (Figure 4.5). Some car- bon chains have double bonds, which vary in number and location. Such variation in carbon chains is one important source of the molecular complexity and diversity that char - acterize living matter. In addition, the skeletons of biological molecules often include atoms of other elements, like oxygen and phosphorus; such atoms can also be bonded to car...",

The rotten-egg odor you may have smelled while walking through a salt marsh or a mudflat signals the presence of sulfate-reducing bacteria. Fermentation is a way of harvesting chemical energy with - out using either O 2 or any electron transport chain—in other words, without cellular respiration. How can food be oxidized without cellular respiration? Remember, oxidation simply refers to the loss of electrons to an electron acceptor, so it does not need to involve O 2 . Glycolysis oxidizes glucose to two mol- ecules of pyruvate. The oxidizing agent of glycolysis is NAD + , and neither O 2 nor any electron transfer chain is involved.

The hydro - carbon chains of fats are similar to gasoline molecules and just as rich in energy. A gram of fat stores more than twice as much energy as a gram of a polysaccharide, such as starch. Because plants are relatively immobile, they can function with bulky energy storage in the form of starch. (Vegetable oils are generally obtained from seeds, where more compact storage is an asset to the plant.) Animals, however, must carry their energy stores with them, so there is an advantage to hav - ing a more compact reservoir of fuel—fat.

In fact, the importance of proteins is underscored by their name, which comes from the Greek word proteios, meaning “first,” or “primary.” Proteins account for more than 50% of the dry mass of most cells, and they are instru - mental in almost everything organisms do. Some proteins speed up chemical reactions, while others play a role in defense, storage, transport, cellular communication, move - ment, or structural support. Figure 5.13 shows examples of proteins with these functions, which you’ll learn more about in later chapters. Life would not be possible without enzymes, most of which are proteins. Enzymatic proteins regulate metabolism by acting as catalysts, chemical agents that selectively speed up chemical reactions without being consumed in the reac - tion. Because an enzyme can perform its function over and over again, these molecules can be thought of as workhorses that keep cells running by carrying out the processes of life. A human has tens of thousands of different proteins, each with a specific structure and function; proteins, in fact, are the most structurally sophisticated molecules known. Consistent with their diverse functions, they vary extensively in structure, each type of protein having a unique three- dimensional shape. Proteins are all constructed from the same set of 20 amino acids, linked in unbranched polymers. The bond between amino acids is called a peptide bond, so a polymer of amino acids is called a polypeptide. A protein is a biologically",

Once the structure URRY8743_12_SE_C05_PRF.indd 8611/6/19 5:48 AM CHAPTER 5 The Structure and Function of Large Biological Molecules 87 Perhaps the most significant impact of genomics and proteomics on the field of biology as a whole has been their contributions to our understanding of evolution. In addition to confirming evidence for evolution from the study of fos - sils and characteristics of currently existing species, genomics has helped us tease out relationships among different groups of organisms that had not been resolved by previous types of evidence, and thus infer evolutionary history. DNA and Proteins as Tape Measures of Evolution EVOLUTION We are accustomed to thinking of shared traits, such as hair and milk production in mammals, as evi- dence of shared ancestry. Because DNA carries heritable infor- mation in the form of genes, sequences of genes and their protein products document the hereditary background of an organism. The linear sequences of nucleotides in DNA mol - ecules are passed from parents to offspring; these sequences determine the amino acid sequences of proteins. As a result, siblings have greater similarity in their DNA and proteins than do unrelated individuals of the same species. Given our evolutionary view of life, we can extend this concept of “molecular genealogy” to relationships between species: We would expect two species that appear to be closely related",

For selected answers, see Appendix A. • Bacteria have various ways of defending themselves against phage infections, including the CRISPR-Cas system. • Many animal viruses have an envelope. Retroviruses (such as HIV) use the enzyme reverse transcriptase to copy their RNA genome into DNA, which can be integrated into the host genome as a provirus. • Since viruses can replicate only within cells, they probably evolved after the first cells appeared, perhaps as packaged frag- ments of cellular nucleic acid. ?

In both images, phosphate groups are yellow, deoxyribose sugars are blue, and nitrogenous bases are shades of green and orange. When molecular detail is not necessary, DNA is portrayed in a range of simplified diagrams, depending on the focus of the figure. Genetic information is carried in DNA as a linear sequence of nucleotides that may be transcribed into mRNA and translated into a polypeptide. When focusing on the DNA sequence, each nucleotide can be represented simply as the letter of its base: A, T, C, or G.

What scientists have learned about eukaryotic DNA replication suggests, however, that most of the process is fundamentally similar for prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Getting Started The replication of chromosomal DNA begins at particular sites called origins of replication, short stretches of DNA that have a specific sequence of nucleotides. The E. coli chromo - some, like many other bacterial chromosomes, is circular and has a single origin. Proteins that initiate DNA replication recog- nize this sequence and attach to the DNA, separating the two strands and opening up a replication “bubble” (Figure 16.13a). Replication of DNA then proceeds in both directions until the entire molecule is copied. In contrast to a bacterial chromosome, a eukaryotic chromosome may have hundreds or even a few thousand replication origins. Multiple replication bubbles form and eventually fuse, thus speeding up the... inciples are the same. Most DNA polymerases require a primer and a DNA tem - plate strand, along which complementary DNA nucleotides are lined up, one by one. In E. coli, DNA polymerase III (abbre- viated DNA pol III) adds a DNA nucleotide to the RNA primer and then continues adding DNA nucleotides, which are complementary to the parental DNA template strand, to the growing end of the new DNA strand. The rate of elongation is about 500 nucleotides per second in bacteria and 50 per second in human cells. Each nucleotide to be added to a growing DNA strand consists of a sugar attached to a base and to three phosphate groups. You have already encountered such a molecule—ATP (adenosine triphosphate; see Figure 8.9). The only difference between the ATP of energy metabolism and dATP, the adenine nucleotide used to make DNA, is the sugar component, which is deoxyribose in the building block of DNA but ribose in ATP. Like ATP, the nucleotides used for DNA synthesis are chemi - cal... NA, the Double Helix Shown below is a ribbon model of DNA, with each ribbon representing one of the polynucleotide strands. The TEM shows a molecule of naked (protein-free) DNA; the double helix is 2 nm across. Histones Proteins called histones are responsi- ble for the main level of DNA packing in interphase chromatin. More than a fifth of a histone’s amino acids are positively charged (Lys or Arg) and therefore bind tightly to the negatively charged DNA. Four types of histones are most common in chromatin. The histones are very similar among eukaryotes, probably reflecting their important role in chromatin structure. Nucleosomes in a 10-nm Fiber In electron micrographs, unfolded chromatin is roughly 10 nm in diame- ter (the 10-nm fiber). Such chromatin resembles beads on a string (see the TEM). Each “bead” is a nucleosome, the basic unit of DNA packing; the “string” between beads is called linker DNA. A nucleosome consists of DNA wound twice around a prot...",

If, in our example, the environment provides all the tryptophan the cell needs, the cell stops making the enzymes that catalyze the synthesis of tryptophan (Figure 18.2b). In this case, the control of enzyme production occurs at the level of transcrip - tion, the synthesis of messenger RNA from the genes that code for these enzymes. Regulation of the tryptophan synthesis pathway is just one example of how bacteria tune their metabolism to chang - ing environments. Many genes of the bacterial genome are switched on or off by changes in the metabolic status of the cell; some genes are regulated singly and others as groups of related genes. One basic mechanism for this type of regula - tion of groups of genes in bacteria, described as the operon model, was discovered in 1961 by François Jacob and Jacques Monod at the Pasteur Institute in Paris. Let’s see what an operon is and how it works. URRY8743_12_SE_C18_PRF.indd 36611/6/19 10:35 AM CHAPTER 18 ... peron are silenced (Figure 18.4a). If lactose is added to the cell’s surroundings, allolactose binds to the lac repressor and alters its shape so the repressor can no longer bind to the operator. Without the lac repressor bound, the lac operon is transcribed into mRNA, and the enzymes for using lactose are made (Figure 18.4b). In the context of gene regulation, the enzymes of the lac - tose pathway are referred to as inducible enzymes because their synthesis is induced by a chemical signal (allolactose, in this case). Analogously, the enzymes for tryptophan synthesis are said to be repressible.

During the Nazi blockade of food transport into the Netherlands near the end of World War II, the population was starving, including this mother and her two children. Children of mothers who were pregnant during that time have experienced long-term effects. (Figure 18.8b). Over time, doctors found that the offspring of women in early pregnancy at that time experienced adverse health effects as adults: higher rates of obesity, high triglyc - eride and cholesterol levels, type 2 diabetes, and schizophre- nia. Furthermore, the affected individuals had a 10% higher mortality rate after the age of 68 than their siblings who were in utero when food was readily available.

Each subunit has one DNA-binding domain (lower half) and one activation domain (upper half). The latter includes binding sites for the other subunit and for other proteins.

Other repressors interfere with the activator itself so it can’t bind the DNA. In addition to influencing transcription directly, some activators and repressors indirectly affect chromatin struc - ture. Studies using yeast and mammalian cells show that some activators recruit... nt. To understand how this works, we will consider two basic developmental processes. First, we’ll explore how cells that arise from early embryonic mitoses develop the differences that start each cell along its own differentiation pathway. Second, we’ll see how cellular dif - ferentiation leads to one particular cell type, using muscle development as an example. Cytoplasmic Determinants and Inductive Signals What generates the first differences among cells in an early embryo? And what controls the differentiation of all the vari- ous cell types as development proceeds? You can probably deduce the answer: The specific genes expressed in any par- ticular cell of a developing organism determine its path. Two sources of information, used to varying extents in different species, “tell” a cell which genes to express at any given time during embryonic development. One important source of information early in develop - ment is the egg’s cytoplasm, which contains both RNA and prote... the mechanisms of development, it did not reveal the specific the genes for proteins such as myosin and actin that confer the unique properties of skeletal muscle cells. The determination and differentiation of other kinds of tissues may play out in a similar fashion. Experimental results support the idea that master regulatory proteins like MyoD might function by opening the chromatin in certain regions. This allows access to transcription machinery for activation of the next set of cell-type-specific genes. Pattern Formation: Setting Up the Body Plan We have now seen how different programs of gene expression that are activated in the fertilized egg can result in differenti- ated cells and tissues. But for the tissues to function effectively in the organism as a whole, the organism’s body plan—its over- all three-dimensional arrangement—must be established and superimposed on the differentiation process. Let’s look at the molecular basis for the establishment of the body p... - tion would surely be embryonic lethals, mutations with phenotypes causing death at the embryonic or larval stage. Because organisms with embryonic lethal mutations never reproduce, they cannot be bred for study. The researchers dealt with this problem by looking for recessive mutations, which can be propagated in heterozygous flies that act as genetic carriers. Third, cytoplasmic determinants in the egg were known to play a role in axis formation, so the research - ers knew they would have to study the mother’s genes as well as those of the embryo. It is the mother’s genes that we will discuss further as we focus on how the anterior-posterior body axis is set up in the developing egg. Nüsslein-Volhard and Wieschaus began their search for segmentation genes by exposing flies to mutagenic agents and scanning their descendants for dead embryos or larvae with abnormal segmentation or other defects. For example, to find genes that might set up the anterior-posterior axis, t... Activated p53 promotes transcription of the gene for a protein that inhibits the cell cycle. The resulting suppression of cell division ensures that the damaged DNA is not replicated. If the DNA damage is irreparable, then the p53 signal leads to apoptosis. (b) Mutant cell cycle–inhibiting pathway. Mutations causing deficiencies in any pathway component can contribute to the development of cancer. .

The p53 gene has been called the “guardian angel of the genome.” Once the p53 protein is activated—say, by the ATM protein, a protein kinase, after DNA damage—p53 activates several other genes, such as p21. The p21 protein halts the cell cycle by binding to cyclin-dependent kinases, allowing t... t effective, but new treatments are being developed. Currently, patients are treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy, which selectively kills fast-growing cells. Signaling molecule Dimer Herceptin HER2 HER3 A signaling molecule (such as a growth factor) binds as a ligand to a single HER3 (a monomer), allowing it to associ- ate with another HER. Patients with the HER2 subtype are treated with the drug Herceptin, which can bind to HER2. When bound to HER2, Herceptin blocks signaling and excessive cell division in certain patients. Even without a ligand bound, HER2 can associate with another HER. Here, HER3 and HER2 associ- ate closely together, forming a dimer. Formation of a dimer activates each monomer. Each monomer adds phosphate from ATP to the other monomer, triggering a signal transduction pathway. The signal is transduced through the cell, which leads to a cellular response—in this case, turning on genes that trigger cell division. HER2 cells have up to...",

Consider, for instance, the water flea (genus Daphnia). A female Daphnia can produce eggs of two types. One type of egg requires fertilization to develop, but the other type does not and develops instead by parthenogenesis. Daphnia reproduce asexually when environ - mental conditions are favorable and sexually during times of environmental stress. As a result, the switch between sexual and asexual reproduction is roughly linked to season. For some asexual animal species, a cycle of reproduc - tive behavior appears to reflect a sexual evolutionary past. In the parthenogenetic lizard species Aspidoscelis uniparens, reproduction is asexual, and all individuals are female. Nevertheless, these lizards have courtship and mating behav - iors very similar to those of sexual species of Aspidoscelis. One member of each mating pair undergoes ovulation, the pro- duction and release of mature eggs. The other female mimics a male (Figure 46.3a). Over the course of the breeding season, the two lizards alternate roles two or three times. An individ- ual adopts female behavior prior to ovulation, when the con- centration of the hormone estradiol is high, and then switches to male-like behavior after ovulation, when the concentration of the hormone progesterone is high (Figure 46.3b).

EVOLUTION CONNECTION Crossing over is thought to be evolutionarily advantageous because it continually shuffles genetic alleles into novel combinations. It was thought that Y-linked genes might degenerate because they lack homologous genes on the X chromosome with which to pair up prior to crossing over. However, when the Y chromosome was sequenced, scientists discovered eight large regions that were internally homologous to each other, and several genes are duplicates. (Y chromosome researcher David Page has called it a “hall of mirrors.”) How might this be beneficial? 12. SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY DRAW IT Assume you are mapping genes A, B, C, and D in Drosophila. You know that these genes are linked on the same chromosome, and you determine the recombination frequencies between each pair of genes to be as follows: A and B, 8%; A and C, 28%; A and D, 25%; B and C, 20%; B and D, 33%.

The number of genomes that have been fully sequenced has exploded, generating reams of data and prompting development of bioinformatics, the use of com - puter software and other computational tools that can handle and analyze these large data sets. The reverberations of these developments have trans - formed the study of biology and related fields. Biologists often look at problems by analyzing large sets of genes or even comparing whole genomes of different species, an approach called genomics. A similar analysis of large sets of proteins, including their sequences, is called proteomics. (Protein sequences can be determined either by using bio - chemical techniques or by translating the DNA sequences that code for them.) These approaches permeate all fields of biology, some examples of which are shown in Figure 5.26. .

Taken together, genomics and proteomics have advanced our understanding of biology across many different fields. A major aim of evolutionary biology is to understand the relationships among species, both living and extinct. For example, genome sequence comparisons have identified the hippopotamus as the land mammal sharing the most recent common ancestor with whales. (See Figure 22.20.) Most plant species exist in a mutually beneficial partnership with fungi (right) and bacteria associated with the plants’ roots; these interactions improve plant growth. Genome sequencing and analysis of gene expression have allowed characterization of plant-associated communities. Such studies will help advance our understanding of such interactions and may improve agricultural practices. (See the Chapter 31 Scientific Skills Exercise and Figure 37.10.) Identifying the genetic basis for human diseases like cancer helps researchers focus their search for potential future treatments. Currently, sequencing the sets of genes expressed in an individual’s tumor can allow a more targeted approach to treating the cancer, a type of “personalized medicine.” (See Figures 12.20 and 18.27.) New DNA sequencing techniques have allowed decoding of minute quantities of DNA found in ancient tissues from our extinct relatives, the Neanderthals (Homo neanderthalensis). Sequencing the Neanderthal genome has informed our understanding of their physical appearance (as in this reconstruction), as well as their relationship with modern humans. (See Figures 34.51 and 34.52.) The tools of molecular genetics and genomics are increasingly used by forensic ecologists to identify which species of animals and plants are killed illegally. In one case, genomic sequences of DNA from illegal shipments of elephant tusks were used to track down poachers and pinpoint the territory where they were operating. (See Figure 56.8.)

Once geographic isolation has occurred, the separated gene pools may diverge. Different mutations arise, and natu - ral selection and genetic drift may alter allele frequencies in different ways in the separated populations. Reproductive iso- lation may then evolve as a by-product of the genetic diver- gence that results from selection or drift. Figure 24.6 describes an example. On Andros Island, in the Bahamas, populations of the mosquitofish Gambusia hubbsi colonized a series of ponds that later became isolated from one another. Genetic analyses indicate that little or no gene flow currently occurs between the ponds. The envi - ronments of these ponds are very similar except that some contain predatory fishes, while others do not. In ponds with predatory fishes, selection... ulations raised on starch digested starch more efficiently, while those raised on maltose digested maltose more efficiently. The researcher then put flies from the same or differ- ent populations in mating cages and measured mating frequen- cies. All flies used in the mating preference tests were reared for one generation on a standard cornmeal medium. to reproduction between mosquitofish from ponds with predators and those from ponds without predators. Thus, as a by-product of selection for avoiding predators, reproductive barriers have formed in these allopatric populations. Evidence of Allopatric Speciation Many studies provide evidence that speciation can occur in allopatric populations. For example, laboratory studies show that reproductive barriers can develop when populations are isolated experimentally and subjected to different environ - mental conditions (Figure 24.7). Field studies indicate that allopatric speciation also can occur in nature. Consider the 30 speci... are sterile because their chromosomes are not homologous and cannot pair during meiosis. However, such a hybrid may be able to reproduce asexually. This diagram traces one mechanism by which sterile hybrids can give rise to fertile allopolyploids that are members of a new species. URRY8743_12_SE_C24_PRF.indd 51411/8/19 5:11 PM CHAPTER 24 The Origin of Species 515 East when an early cultivated wheat species hybridized with a wild grass. Today, plant geneticists generate new polyploids in the laboratory by using chemicals that induce meiotic and mitotic errors. By harnessing the evolutionary process, researchers can produce new polyploid species with desired qualities, such as a polyploid that combines the high yield of wheat with the hardiness of rye. Mastering Biology Animation: Speciation by Changes in Ploidy Sexual Selection There is evidence that sympatric speciation can also be driven by sexual selection. Clues to how this can occur have been found in cichli... ern of allele frequencies across a hybrid zone? We can infer that there is an obstacle to gene flow—otherwise, alleles from one parent species would also be common in the gene pool of the other parent species. Are geographic barriers reducing gene flow? Not in this case, since the toads can move throughout the hybrid zone. A more important factor is that hybrid toads have increased rates of embryonic mortality and a variety of morphological abnormalities, including ribs that are fused to the spine and malformed tadpole mouthparts. Because the hybrids have poor survival and reproduction, they produce few viable off - spring with members of the parent species. As a result, hybrid individuals rarely serve as a stepping-stone from which alleles are passed from one species to the other. Outside the hybrid zone, additional obstacles to gene flow may be provided by natural selection in the different environments in which the parent species live. Hybrid zones typically are locat... a- tions than for allopatric populations.

But what is the total length of time between speciation events? This interval consists of the time that elapses before populations of a newly formed species start to diverge from one another plus the time it takes for speciation to be complete once divergence begins. It turns out that the total time between speciation events varies considerably. In a survey of",

I was fascinated by the research, I was just turned on—finally, I realized this is what I’d really like to do. Can you tell me about how you got into cancer research? After my Ph.D. and my postdoctoral re- search at Harvard, I realized I wanted to work on animal cells, so I joined Ira Pastan’s group at the National Cancer Institute at the National Institutes of Health, where I eventually got my own lab. Together with Ken Yamada, I was working on a protein called fibronectin, which was present on the outside surface of normal cells but not cancer cells. Fibronectin is a glycoprotein—it has carbohydrates (sugars) attached to it. At the time, there was a hypothesis that the carbohydrates were necessary for fibro- nectin to be exported from the cell, and we decided to test that hypothesis using a drug called tunicamycin that prevented carbohy- drate attachme... ental stimuli, regulates growth and development, and triggers physical and behavioral changes underlying sexual maturity and reproduction (see Figure 45.1). Paracrine and Autocrine Signaling Many types of cells produce and secrete local regulators, molecules that act over short distances, reach their target cells solely by diffusion, and act on their target cells within seconds or even milliseconds. Local regulators play roles in many physiological processes, including blood pressure regulation, nervous system function, and reproduction. CONCEPT 45.1 Synapse Blood vessel Neurosecretory cell Neuron Blood vessel (a) In endocrine signaling, secreted molecules diffuse into the blood- stream and trigger responses in target cells anywhere in the body. (b) In paracrine signaling, secreted molecules diffuse locally and trigger a response in neighboring cells.

The release of hormones synthesized in the anterior pituitary gland is controlled by hypothalamic releasing and inhibiting hormones. The hypothalamic hormones are secreted by neurosecretory cells and enter a capillary network within the hypothalamus. T... Catecholamines also alter blood flow, causing constriction of some blood vessels and dilation of others. The overall effect is to shunt blood away from the skin, digestive organs, and kidneys while increasing the blood supply to the heart, brain, and skeletal muscles. Adrenal Hormones: Response to Stress The adrenal glands of vertebrates play a major role in the response to stress, a state of threatened homeostasis. Located atop the kidneys (the renal organs), each adrenal gland is actually made up of two glands with different cell types, functions, and embryonic origins: the adrenal cortex, the outer portion, and the adrenal medulla, the central portion (Figure 45.19). The adrenal cortex consists of true endocrine cells, whereas the secretory cells of the adrenal medulla develop from neural tissue. Thus, like the pituitary gland, each adrenal gland is a fused endocrine and neuroendocrine gland. The Role of the Adrenal Medulla Imagine that while walking in the woods at nig...",

For example, most terrestrial mammals are nocturnal, which makes visual displays relatively ineffective. Instead, these species use olfactory and auditory signals, which work as well in the dark as in the light. In contrast, most birds are diurnal (active mainly in daytime) and communicate primarily by visual and auditory signals. Humans are also diurnal and, like birds, use primarily visual and auditory communication. We can thus detect and appreciate the songs and bright colors used by birds to communicate but miss many chemical cues on which other mammals base their behavior. The information content of animal communication var - ies considerably. One of the most remarkable examples is the symbolic language of the European honeybee (Apis mellifera), discovered in the early 1900s by Austrian researc... ose the arm with the different pattern. The maze experiments provide strong experimental sup - port for the hypothesis that honeybees can distinguish on the basis of “same” and “different.” Remarkably, research published in 2010 indicates that honeybees can also learn to distinguish human faces. The information-processing ability of a nervous system can also be revealed in problem solving, the cognitive . Figure 51.9 Associative learning. Having ingested and vomited a monarch butterfly, a blue jay has probably learned to avoid this species. Mastering Biology HHMI Video: How Lizards Find Their Way Home Associative Learning Learning often involves making associations between experi- ences. Consider, for example, a blue jay (Cyanocitta cristata) that ingests a brightly colored monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus). Substances that the monarch accumulates from milkweed plants cause the blue jay to vomit almost imme - diately (Figure 51.9). Following such experiences, blue ja... mate choice is a healthy male is likely to pro - duce more offspring that survive to re- produce. As a result, males may compete with each other in ritualized contests to attract female attention (Figure 51.16). In face-offs between male stalk-eyed flies, the male whose eyestalk length is smaller usually retreats peacefully. Mate choice can also be influenced by imprinting, as revealed by experiments carried out with zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata). Both male and female zebra finches normally lack any feather crest on their head (Figure 51.17). To explore whether parental appearance affects mate pref- erence in offspring independent of any genetic influence, researchers provided zebra finches with artificial ornamen- tation. A 2.5-cm-long red feather was taped to the forehead feathers of either or both zebra finch parents when their chicks were 8 days old, approximately 2 days before they opened their eyes. A control group of zebra finches was raised by unadorned pa... look more closely at some examples of unselfish behavior and con - sider how they might arise. In discussing selflessness, we will use the term altruism to describe a behavior that reduces an animal’s individual fitness but increases the fitness of other individuals in the population. Consider, for example, the Belding’s ground squirrel (Urocitellus beldingi), which lives in the western United States and is vulnerable to predators such as coyotes and hawks. A squirrel that sees a predator approach often gives a high-pitched alarm call that alerts unaware indi - viduals to retreat to their burrows. In warning others, how- ever, this squirrel brings attention to its location and thus increases its own risk of being killed. Another example of altruistic behavior occurs in honey - bee societies, in which the workers are sterile. The workers themselves never reproduce, but they labor on behalf of a single fertile queen. Furthermore, the workers sting intruders, a behavior that h...",
