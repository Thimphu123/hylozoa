In feedback regulation, the output or product of a process regulates that very process. The most com - mon form of regulation in living systems is negative feedback, a loop in which the response reduces the ini- tial stimulus. As seen in the example of insulin signaling (Figure 1.10), after a meal the level of the sugar glucose in your blood rises, which stimulates cells of the pancreas to secrete insulin. Insulin, in turn, causes body cells to take up glucose and liver cells to store it, thus decreas - ing the blood glucose level. This eliminates the stimulus for insulin secretion, shutting off the pathway. Thus, the output of the process (insulin) negatively regulates that process. Though less common than processes regulated by nega - tive feedback, there are also many biological processes regu- lated by positive feedback, in which an end product speeds up its own...",

Science and religion are not mutually exclu- sive or contradictory; they are simply concerned with different issues. The Flexibility of the Scientific Process The way that researchers answer questions about the natural and physical world is often idealized as the scientific method. However, very few scientific inquiries adhere rigidly to the sequence of steps that are typically used to describe this approach. For example, a scientist may start to design an experiment, but then backtrack after realizing that more preliminary observations are necessary. In...",

When the gates of the reservoir’s dam are opened and the water runs downhill, the energy can be used to do work, such as moving the blades of turbines to generate electricity. Because energy has been expended, the water has less energy at the bottom of the hill than it did in the reser - voir. Matter has a natural tendency to move toward the lowest possible state of potential energy; in our example, the water runs downhill. To restore the potential energy of a reservoir, work must be done to elevate the water against gravity.

Carbon skeletons vary in length and may be straight, branched, or arranged in closed rings (Figure 4.5). Some car- bon chains have double bonds, which vary in number and location. Such variation in carbon chains is one important source of the molecular complexity and diversity that char - acterize living matter.

Look at the electron distribution diagram for silicon in Figure 2.7 and draw the Lewis dot structure for silicon. What properties does silicon share with carbon that would make silicon-based life more likely than, say, neon-based life or aluminum-based life? 10. SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY Fifty years ago, pregnant women who were prescribed thalidomide for morning sickness gave birth to children with birth defects. Thalidomide is a mixture of two enantiomers; one reduces morning sickness, but the other causes severe birth defects. Today, the FDA has approved this drug for non-pregnant individuals with Hansen’s disease (leprosy) or newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, a blood and bone marrow cancer. The beneficial enantiomer can be synthesized and given to patients, but over time, both the beneficial and the harmful enantiomer can be detected in the body. Propose a possible explanation for the presence of the harmful enantiomer. 11. WRITE ABOUT A THEME: ORGANIZATION In 1918, an epidemic of sleeping sickness caused an unusual rigid paralysis in some survivors, similar to symptoms of advanced Parkinson’s disease. Years later, L-dopa (below, left), a chemical used to treat Parkinson’s disease, was given to some of these patients. L-dopa was remarkably effective at eliminating the paralysis, at least temporarily. However, its enantiomer, D-dopa (right), was subsequently shown to have no effect at all, as is the case for Parkinson’s disease. In a short essay (100–150 words), discuss how the effectiveness of one enantiomer and not the other illustrates the theme of structure and function.

Glucose, fructose, and other sugars that have six carbons are called hexoses. Trioses (three-carbon sugars) and pentoses (five-carbon sugars) are also common. Still another source of diversity for simple sugars is in the way their parts are arranged spatially around asym - metric carbons. (Recall that an asymmetric carbon is a car- bon attached to four different atoms or groups of atoms.) Glucose and galactose, for example, differ only in the place- ment of parts around one asymmetric carbon (see the purple boxes in Figure 5.3). What seems like a small difference is significant enough to give the two sugars distinctive shapes and binding activities, thus different behaviors. Although it is convenient to draw glucose with a linear car - bon skeleton, this representation is not completely accurate. In aqueous solutions, glucose molecules, as well as most ...",

Similarly, a termite, which is unable to digest cellulose by itself, has prokaryotes or protists living in its gut that can make a meal of wood. Some fungi can also digest cellulose in soil and elsewhere, thereby helping recycle chemical elements within Earth’s ecosystems.

Within the backbone, the oxygen atoms have a partial negative charge, and the hydrogen atoms attached to the nitrogens have a partial positive charge (see Figure 2.14); therefore, hydrogen bonds can form between these atoms. Individually, these hydrogen bonds are weak, but because they are repeated many times over a relatively long region of the polypeptide chain, they can support a particular shape for that part of the protein. One such secondary structure is the c helix, a delicate coil held together by hydrogen bonding between every fourth amino acid, as shown above.

Most of the discussion of cell structure that follows in this chapter applies to eukaryotic cells. A Panoramic View of the Eukaryotic Cell In addition to the plasma membrane at its outer surface, a eukaryotic cell has extensive, elaborately arranged internal membranes that divide the cell into compartments—the organelles mentioned earlier. The cell’s compartments pro - vide different local environments that support specific meta- bolic functions, so incompatible processes can occur simulta- neously in a single cell.

Water Balance of Cells Without Cell Walls To explain the behavior of a cell in a solution, we must consider both solute concentration and membrane permeability. Both factors are taken into account in the concept of tonicity, the ability of a surrounding solution to cause a cell to gain or lose water. The tonicity of a solution depends in part on its concen - tration of solutes that cannot cross the membrane (nonpene- trating solutes) relative to that inside the cell. If there is a higher concentration of nonpenetrating solutes in the surrounding solution, water will tend to leave the cell, and vice versa. If a cell without a cell wall, such as an animal cell, is immersed in an environment that is isotonic to the cell (iso means “same”), there will be no net movement of water across the plasma mem - brane.

In the case of ions, then, we must refine our concept of pas - sive transport: An ion diffuses not simply down its concentration gradient but, more exactly, down its electrochemical gradient. For example, the concentration of Na + inside a resting nerve cell is much lower than outside it. When the cell is stimulated, gated channels open that facilitate Na + diffusion. Sodium ions then “fall” down their electrochemical gradient, driven by the concentration gradient of Na + and by the attraction of these cations to the negative side (inside) of the membrane. In this example, both electrical and chemical contributions to the electrochemical gradient act in the same direction across the membrane, but this is not always so. In cases where electrical forces due to the membrane potential oppose the simple diffu - sion of an ion down its conce...",

SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY An experiment is designed to study the mechanism of sucrose uptake by plant cells. Cells are immersed in a sucrose solution, and the pH of the solution is monitored. Samples of the cells are taken at intervals, and their sucrose concentration is measured. The pH is observed to decrease until it reaches a steady, slightly acidic level, and then sucrose uptake begins. (a) Evaluate these results and propose a hypothesis to explain them. (b) Predict what would happen if an inhibitor of ATP regeneration by the cell were added to the beaker once the pH was at a steady level. Explain. 9. SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, AND SOCIETY Extensive irrigation in arid regions causes salts to accumulate in the soil. (When water evaporates, salts that were dissolved in the water are left behind in the soil.) Based on what you learned about water balance in plant cells, explain why increased soil salinity (saltiness) might be harmful to crops. 10. WRITE ABOUT A THEME: INTERACTIONS A human pancreatic cell obtains O 2 —and necessary molecules such as glucose, amino acids, and cholesterol—from its environment, and it releases CO 2 as a waste product. In response to hormonal signals, the cell secretes digestive enzymes. It also regulates its ion concentrations by exchange with its environment. Based on what you have just learned about the structure and function of cellular membranes, write a short essay (100–150 words) to describe how such a cell accomplishes these interactions with its environment. 11. SYNTHESIZE YOUR KNOWLEDGE In the supermarket, lettuce and other produce are often sprayed with water. Explain why this makes vegetables crisp. CONCEPT 7.5 Bulk transport across the plasma membrane occurs by exocytosis and endocytosis (pp. 139–141) • In exocytosis, transport vesicles migrate to the plasma membrane, fuse with it, and release their contents. In endocytosis, molecules enter cells within vesicles that pinch inward from the plasma membrane. The three types of endocytosis are phagocytosis, pinocytosis, and receptor-mediated endocytosis. ? Which type of endocytosis involves the binding of specific substances in the extracellular fluid to membrane proteins? What does this type of transport enable a cell to do?

(You’ll see specific examples of this type of regulation when you learn about cellular respiration in the next chapter; see, for example, Figure 9.19.) ATP, ADP, and other related molecules also affect key enzymes in anabolic pathways. In this way, allosteric enzymes control the rates of important reactions in both sorts of metabolic pathways. In another kind of allosteric activation, a substrate molecule binding to one active site in a multisubunit enzyme triggers a shape change in all the subunits, thereby increas - ing catalytic activity at the other active sites (Figure 8.20b).

Pyruvate enters the mitochondrion through a transport protein and is processed by a complex of several enzymes known as pyruvate dehydrogenase (shown in the computer-generated image based on cryo-EMs). This complex catalyzes the three numbered steps, which are described in the text. The CO 2 molecule will diffuse out of the cell. The NADH will be used in oxidative phosphorylation.

Conversion between DHAP and G3P: This reaction never reaches equilibrium; G3P is used in the next step as fast as it forms.

The resulting global climate change, including an increase in aver- age temperatures around the planet, may have far-reaching effects on plant species. Scientists are concerned that increas- ing CO 2 concentration and temperature may affect C 3 and C 4 plants differently, thus changing the relative abundance of these species in a given plant community. Which type of plant would stand to gain more from increas - ing CO 2 levels? Recall that in C 3 plants, the binding of O 2 rather than CO 2 by rubisco leads to photorespiration, lowering the efficiency of photosynthesis.

One effect of epinephrine is to mobilize fuel reserves, which can be used by the animal to either defend itself (fight) or try to escape (flight). Epinephrine stimulates the breakdown of the storage polysaccharide glycogen within liver cells and skeletal muscle cells. The breakdown of glycogen releases the sugar glucose 1-phosphate, which the cell converts to glucose 6-phosphate. The liver or muscle cell can then use this com - pound, an early intermediate in glycolysis, for energy pro- duction (see Figure 9.8). Alternatively, the compound can be stripped of phosphate and released from the liver cell into the blood as glucose, which can fuel cells throughout the body.

In a phosphorylation cascade, a series of different proteins in a pathway are phosphorylated in turn, each protein adding a phosphate group to the next one in line. Here, phosphorylation activates each protein, and dephosphorylation returns it to its inactive form. The active and inactive forms of each protein are represented by different shapes to remind you that activation is usually associated with a change in molecular shape. WHAT IF?

Within a cell whose DNA has been irretrievably damaged, a series of protein- protein interactions can pass along a signal that similarly triggers cell death. Considering some examples of apoptosis can help us to see how signaling pathways are integrated in cells. Apoptosis in the Soil Worm Caenorhabditis elegans The molecular mechanisms of apoptosis were worked out by researchers studying embryonic development of a small soil worm, a nematode called Caenorhabditis elegans. Because the adult worm has only about 1,000 cells, the researchers were able to work out the entire ancestry of each cell. The timely suicide of cells occurs exactly 131 times during normal devel - opment of C. elegans, at precisely the same points in the cell lineage of each worm. In worms and other species, apoptosis is triggered by signals that activate a cascade of “suicide” pro - teins in the cells destined to die. Genetic r...",

SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY Epinephrine initiates a signal transduction pathway that produces cyclic AMP (cAMP) and leads to the breakdown of glycogen to glucose, a major energy source for cells. But glycogen breakdown is only part of the fight-or-flight response that epinephrine brings about; the overall effect on the body includes an increase in heart rate and alertness, as well as a burst of energy. Given that caffeine blocks the activity of cAMP phosphodiesterase, propose a mechanism by which caffeine ingestion leads to heightened alertness and sleeplessness. 11. SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, AND SOCIETY The aging process is thought to be initiated at the cellular level. Among the changes that can occur after a certain number of cell divisions is the loss of a cell’s ability to respond to growth factors and other signals. Much research into aging is aimed at understanding such losses, with the ultimate goal of extending the human life span. Not everyone, however, agrees that this is a desirable goal. If life expectancy were greatly increased, discuss what might be the social and ecological consequences. 12. WRITE ABOUT A THEME: ORGANIZATION The properties of life emerge at the biological level of the cell. The highly regulated process of apoptosis is not simply the destruction of a cell; it is also an emergent property. Write a short essay (about 100–150 words) that briefly explains the role of apoptosis in the development and proper functioning of an animal, and describe how this form of programmed cell death is a process that emerges from the orderly integration of signaling pathways. 13. SYNTHESIZE YOUR KNOWLEDGE There are five basic tastes—sour, salty, sweet, bitter, and “umami.” Salt is detected when the concentration of salt outside of a taste bud cell is higher than that inside of it, and ion channels allow the passive leakage of Na + into the cell. The resulting change in membrane potential (see Concept 7.4) sends the “salty” signal to the brain. Umami is a savory taste generated by glutamate (glutamic acid, found in monosodium glutamate, or MSG), which is used as a flavor enhancer in foods such as taco-flavored tortilla chips. The glutamate receptor is a GPCR, which, when bound, initiates a signaling pathway that ends with a cellular response, perceived by you as “taste.” If you eat a regular potato chip and then rinse your mouth, you will no longer taste salt. But if you eat a flavored tortilla chip and then rinse, the taste persists. (Try it!) Propose a possible explanation for this difference. For selected answers, see Appendix A.

        "content": "um Escherichia coli is about 500 times as long as the cell. For such a long chromo - some to fit within the cell, it must be highly coiled and folded. In some bacteria, the process of cell division is initiated when the DNA of the bacterial chromosome begins to repli - cate at a specific place on the chromosome called the origin of replication, producing two origins. As the chromosome continues to replicate, one origin moves rapidly toward the opposite end of the cell (Figure 12.12). While the chromo- some is replicating, the cell elongates. When replication is complete and the bacterium has reached about twice its initial size, proteins cause its plasma membrane to pinch inward, dividing the parent bacterial cell into two daughter cells. In this way, each cell inherits a complete genome. Using the techniques of modern DNA technology to tag the origins of replication with molecules that glow green in fluo - rescence microscopy (see Figure 6.3), researchers have directly obs...",

As Figure 15.9 shows, both of the combinations of traits not seen in the P generation (called nonparental phenotypes) were also produced in Morgan’s experiments, suggesting that the body color and wing size alleles are not always linked genetically. To understand this conclusion, we need to fur - ther explore genetic recombination, the production of offspring with combinations of traits that differ from those found in either P generation parent. Genetic Recombination and Linkage Meiosis and random fertilization generate genetic variation among offspring of sexually reproducing organisms due to independent assortment of chromosomes, crossing over in meiosis I, and the possibility of any sperm fertilizing any egg (see Concept 13.4).

EVOLUTION CONNECTION Crossing over is thought to be evolutionarily advantageous because it continually shuffles genetic alleles into novel combinations. It was thought that Y-linked genes might degenerate because they lack homologous genes on the X chromosome with which to pair up prior to crossing over. However, when the Y chromosome was sequenced, scientists discovered eight large regions that were internally homologous to each other, and several genes are duplicates. (Y chromosome researcher David Page has called it a “hall of mirrors.”) How might this be beneficial? 12. SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY DRAW IT Assume you are mapping genes A, B, C, and D in Drosophila. You know that these genes are linked on the same chromosome, and you determine the recombination frequencies between each pair of genes to be as follows: A and B, 8%; A and C, 28%; A and D, 25%; B and C, 20%; B and D, 33%.

The E. coli chromo - some, like many other bacterial chromosomes, is circular and has a single origin. Proteins that initiate DNA replication recog- nize this sequence and attach to the DNA, separating the two strands and opening up a replication “bubble” (Figure 16.13a).

The rate of elongation is about 500 nucleotides per second in bacteria and 50 per second in human cells. Each nucleotide to be added to a growing DNA strand consists of a sugar attached to a base and to three phosphate groups.

(Remember that the final products of some genes are not polypeptides but RNA molecules that don’t get translated, including tRNAs and rRNAs.) In general, the steps of transcription and translation are similar in bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic cells. The major difference is the occurrence of RNA processing in the eukaryotic nucleus. Other significant differences are found in the initiation stages of both transcription and translation and in the termination of transcription.

Researchers have developed a variety of methods to test the mutagenic activity of chemicals. A major application of these tests is the preliminary screening of chemicals to identify those that may cause cancer. This approach makes sense because most carcinogens (cancer-causing chemicals) are mutagenic, and conversely, most mutagens are carcinogenic. Using CRISPR to Edit Genes and Correct Disease-Causing Mutations Ever since biologists have understood how disease-causing proteins were the result of mutations in genes, they have sought techniques for gene editing—altering genes in a specific, predictable way. Their aim has been to use such a Mastering Biology Interview with Francisco Mojica: Discovering CRISPR in bacteria (see the interview before Chapter 13) URRY8743_12_SE_C17_PRF.indd 36011/8/19 4:54 PM CHAPTER 17 Gene ...",

If, in our example, the environment provides all the tryptophan the cell needs, the cell stops making the enzymes that catalyze the synthesis of tryptophan (Figure 18.2b). In this case, the control of enzyme production occurs at the level of transcrip - tion, the synthesis of messenger RNA from the genes that code for these enzymes. Regulation of the tryptophan synthesis pathway is just one example of how bacteria tune their metabolism to chang - ing environments. Many genes of the bacterial genome are switched on or off by changes in the metabolic status of the cell; some genes are regulated singly and others as groups of related genes. One basic mechanism for this type of regula - tion of groups of genes in bacteria, described as the operon model, was discovered in 1961 by François Jacob and Jacques Monod at the Pasteur Institute in Paris.

Cytoplasmic Determinants and Inductive Signals What generates the first differences among cells in an early embryo? And what controls the differentiation of all the vari- ous cell types as development proceeds? You can probably deduce the answer: The specific genes expressed in any par- ticular cell of a developing organism determine its path. Two sources of information, used to varying extents in different species, “tell” a cell which genes to express at any given time during embryonic development.

This allows access to transcription machinery for activation of the next set of cell-type-specific genes.

Because organisms with embryonic lethal mutations never reproduce, they cannot be bred for study. The researchers dealt with this problem by looking for recessive mutations, which can be propagated in heterozygous flies that act as genetic carriers. Third, cytoplasmic determinants in the egg were known to play a role in axis formation, so the research - ers knew they would have to study the mother’s genes as well as those of the embryo. It is the mother’s genes that we will discuss further as we focus on how the anterior-posterior body axis is set up in the developing egg.

Explain how this drug could prevent infection in someone exposed to the flu or could shorten the course of flu in an infected patient (the reasons for which it is prescribed). For selected answers, see Appendix A. • Bacteria have various ways of defending themselves against phage infections, including the CRISPR-Cas system. • Many animal viruses have an envelope. Retroviruses (such as HIV) use the enzyme reverse transcriptase to copy their RNA genome into DNA, which can be integrated into the host genome as a provirus. • Since viruses can replicate only within cells, they probably evolved after the first cells appeared, perhaps as packaged frag- ments of cellular nucleic acid. ? Describe enzymes that are not found in most cells but are necessary for the replication of certain types of viruses.

The FBI started applying DNA technology to forensics in 1988, using a method involving gel electrophoresis and nucleic acid hybridization to detect similarities and differences in DNA samples. This method required much smaller samples of blood or tissue than earlier methods—only about 1,000 cells. Mastering Biology Animation: Genetic Profiles Today, forensic scientists use an even more sensitive method that takes advantage of variations in length of genetic markers called short tandem repeats (STRs). These are tandemly repeated units of two- to five-nucleotide sequences in specific regions of the genome. The number of repeats present in these regions is highly variable from person to person (polymorphic); even for a single individual, the two alleles of an STR may differ from each other. For example, one individual may have the sequence ACAT repeated 30 times at one genome locus and 15 times at the same locus on the ...",

We can characterize a population’s genetic makeup by describing its gene pool, which consists of all copies of every type of allele at every locus in all members of the population. If only one allele exists for a particular locus in a population, that allele is said to be fixed in the gene pool, and all individu - als are homozygous for that allele. But if there are two or more alleles for a particular locus in a population, individuals may be either homozygous or heterozygous. For example, imagine a population of 500 wildflower plants with two alleles, C R and C W , for a locus that codes for flower pigment. These alleles show incomplete dominance; thus, each genotype has a distinct phenotype. Plants homozygous for the C R allele (C R C R ) produce red pigment and have red flowers; plants homozygous for the...",

As described in Figure 23.18, heterozygotes for the sickle-cell allele are protected against the most severe effects of malaria, a disease caused by a parasite that infects red blood cells. One reason for this partial protection is that the body destroys sickled red blood cells rapidly, killing the parasites they harbor. Malaria is a major killer in some tropical regions. In such regions, selec - tion favors heterozygotes over homozygous dominant individu- als, who are more vulnerable to the effects of malaria, and also over homozygous recessive individuals, who develop sickle-cell disease. These selective pressures have caused the frequency of the sickle-cell allele to reach relatively high levels in areas where the malaria parasite, which is carried by mosquitoes, is common.

Thus, as a by-product of selection for avoiding predators, reproductive barriers have formed in these allopatric populations.

For example, laboratory studies show that reproductive barriers can develop when populations are isolated experimentally and subjected to different environ - mental conditions (Figure 24.7).

Are geographic barriers reducing gene flow? Not in this case, since the toads can move throughout the hybrid zone. A more important factor is that hybrid toads have increased rates of embryonic mortality and a variety of morphological abnormalities, including ribs that are fused to the spine and malformed tadpole mouthparts. Because the hybrids have poor survival and reproduction, they produce few viable off - spring with members of the parent species. As a result, hybrid individuals rarely serve as a stepping-stone from which alleles are passed from one species to the other.

It turns out that the total time between speciation events varies considerably. In a survey of data from 84 groups of plants and animals, speciation intervals ranged from 4,000 years (in cichlids of Lake Nabugabo, Uganda) to 40 million years (in some beetles). Overall, the time between speciation events averaged 6.5 million years and was rarely less than 500,000 years.

From a phylogeny of maize based on DNA data, researchers have identified two species of wild grasses that may be maize’s closest living rela - tives. These two close relatives may be useful as “reservoirs” of beneficial alleles that can be transferred to cultivated maize by cross-breeding or genetic engineering.

Thus, for a character that only occurs in a sub- set of the ingroup, we’ll assume that the character arose in the lineage leading to those members of the ingroup. By comparing members of the ingroup with each other and with the outgroup, we can determine which characters were derived at the various branch points of vertebrate evo - lution. In our example, all of the vertebrates in the ingroup have backbones: This character was present in the ancestral vertebrate, but not in the outgroup.

Note that the total length of the horizontal lines from the base of the tree to the mouse is less than that of the line leading to the fruit fly, Drosophila. This indicates that fewer genetic changes have occurred in the mouse lineage than in the Drosophila lineage. In addition, because the mouse and fly lineages have evolved for an equal amount of time after they diverged from a common ancestor, the rate of change was lower in mouse lineage than in the Drosophila lineage. In general, although the branches of a phylogenetic tree may have different lengths, among organisms alive today, all the different lineages that descend from a common ances - tor have survived for the same number of years. To take an extreme example, humans and bacteria had a common ances- tor that lived over 3 billion years ago. Fossils and genetic evidence indicate that this ancestor was a single-celled pro- karyote.

But how can we deter - mine the timing of phylogenies that extend beyond the fossil record? Molecular Clocks We stated earlier that researchers have estimated that the common ancestor of Hawaiian silversword plants lived about 5 million years ago. How did they make this estimate? They relied on the concept of a molecular clock, an approach for measuring the absolute time of evolutionary change based on the observation that some genes and other regions of genomes appear to evolve at constant rates. An assump - tion underlying the molecular clock is that the number of nucleotide substitutions in orthologous genes is proportional to the time that has elapsed since the genes branched from their common ancestor. In the case of paralogous genes, the number of substitutions is proportional to the time since the ancestral gene was du...",

SYNTHESIZE YOUR KNOWLEDGE This West Indian manatee (Trichechus manatus) is an aquatic mammal. Like amphibians and reptiles, mammals are tetrapods (vertebrates with four limbs). Explain why manatees are considered tetrapods even though they lack hind limbs, and suggest traits that manatees likely share with leopards and other mammals (see Figure 26.12b). Discuss how early members of the manatee lineage might have differed from today’s manatees. For selected answers, see Appendix A. • Phylogenies based in part on rRNA genes suggest that eukaryotes are most closely related to archaea, while data from some other genes suggest a closer relationship to bacteria. • Genetic analyses indicate that extensive horizontal gene transfer has occurred throughout the evolutionary history of life. ?

Cell-Surface Structures A key feature of nearly all prokaryotic cells is the cell wall, which maintains cell shape, protects the cell, and prevents it from bursting in a hypotonic environment (see Figure 7.13). In a hypertonic environment, most prokaryotes lose water and shrink away from their wall. Such water losses can inhibit cell reproduction. Thus, salt can be used to preserve foods because it causes food-spoiling prokaryotes to lose water, preventing them from reproducing rapidly. The cell walls of prokaryotes differ in structure from those of eukaryotes. In eukaryotes that have cell walls, such as plants and fungi, the walls are usually made of cellulose or chitin (see Concept 5.2). In contrast, most bacterial cell walls contain peptidoglycan, a polymer composed of modified sugars cross-linked by short polypeptides. This molecular fab - ric encloses the entire bacterium and anchors other molecules that extend from its surface. Archaeal cell walls...",

Among prokaryotes, bacterial and archaeal flagella are similar in size and rotational mechanism, but they are composed of entirely different and unrelated proteins. Overall, these structural and molecular comparisons indicate that the flagella of bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes arose independently. Since current evidence shows that the flagella of organisms in the three domains perform similar functions but are not related by common descent, they are described as analogous, not homologous, structures (see Concept 22.3). Evolutionary Origins of Bacterial Flagella The bacterial flagellum shown in Figure 27.7 has three main parts (the motor, hook, and filament) that are themselves composed of 42 different kinds of proteins. How could such a complex structure evolve? In fact, much evidence indicates that bacterial flagella originated as simpler structures that were modified in a stepwise fashion over time.

Such organelles provide specific locations where particular cellular functions are accomplished, making the structure and organization of eukaryotic cells more complex than those of prokaryotic cells.

As a result, differences among these genes reflect the history of speciation events that have occurred since the eukaryotes began to diverge from their last common ancestor—making these genes well suited for inferring the root of the eukary- otic tree. Derelle and colleagues obtained the sequences of these genes for 67 species of eukaryotes representing a wide range of eukaryotic taxa. Those sequences were then used to infer evolutionary relationships among the four eukaryotic supergroups shown in Figure 28.5. Results Unikonta ExcavataExcavata SAR Archaeplastida Common ancestor of all eukaryotes Conclusion The results show that Excavata, SAR, and Archaeplastida form a clade, which supports the hypothesis that the root of the tree is located between the unikonts and all other eukaryotes.

The multicellular, dependent embryo of plants is such a significant derived trait that plants are also known as embryophytes. includes both multicellular haploid organisms and multicellular dip- loid organisms. The multicellular haploid gametophyte (“gamete- producing plant”) is named for its production by mitosis of haploid gametes—eggs and sperm—that fuse during fertilization, forming diploid zygotes. Mitotic division of the zygote produces a multicel- lular diploid sporophyte (“spore-producing plant”).

The game- tophytes, which are usually 1–2 cm in diameter, grow mostly hori- zontally and often have multiple sporophytes attached. Hornworts are frequently among the first species to colonize open areas with moist soils; a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing cyanobac- teria contributes to their ability to do this (nitrogen is often in short supply in such areas). Hornworts (Phylum Anthocerophyta) Moss gametophytes, which range in height from less than 1 mm to 60 cm, are less than 15 cm tall in most species. The familiar carpet of moss you observe consists mainly of gametophytes. The blades of their “leaves” are usually only one cell thick, but more complex “leaves” that have ridges coated with cuticle can be found on the common hairy-cap moss (Polytrichum, below) and its close relatives.

In most species, sporophytes have stalked sporangia with springlike devices that catapult spores several meters. Air- borne spores can be carried far from their origin. Some species produce more than a trillion spores in a plant’s lifetime. The group’s name refers to the brushy ap- pearance of the stems, which have a gritty texture that made them historically useful as “scouring rushes” for pots and pans.

Next, we’ll look at the development of the female gametophyte within an ovule and the development of the male gametophyte in a pollen grain. Then we’ll follow the transformation of a fertilized ovule into a seed. Ovules and Production of Eggs Although a few species of seedless plants are heterosporous, seed plants are unique in retaining the megasporangium within the parent sporophyte. A layer of sporophyte tissue called integument envelops and protects the megasporangium.

Fertilization usually occurs more than a year after pollination. All eggs may be fertilized, but usually only one zygote develops into an embryo. The ovule becomes a seed, consisting of an embryo, food supply, and seed coat. While the pollen tube develops, the megasporocyte undergoes meiosis, producing four haploid cells. One survives as a megaspore. The megaspore develops into a female gametophyte that contains two or three archegonia, each of which will form an egg. Pollination occurs when a pollen grain reaches the ovule. The pollen grain then germinates, forming a pollen tube that slowly digests its way through the megasporangium. .

A stamen consists of a stalk called the filament and a terminal sac, the anther, where pollen is produced. Carpels are megasporophylls: They produce megaspores that give rise to female gametophytes. The carpel is the “container” mentioned earlier in which seeds are enclosed; as such, it is a key structure that distinguishes angiosperms from gymno - sperms. At the tip of the carpel is a sticky stigma that receives pollen. A style leads from the stigma to a structure at the base of the carpel, the ovary; the ovary contains one or more ovules. As in gymnosperms, each angiosperm ovule contains a female gametophyte. If fertilized, an ovule develops into a seed. A flower may have one or more carpels. In many species, multiple carpels are fused into one structure. The term pistil is sometimes used to refer to a single carpel (a simple pistil) or two ...",

Archaefructus, for example, was herbaceous and had bulbous structures that may have served as floats, suggesting it was aquatic. But investigating whether the angiosperm common ancestor was herbaceous and aquatic also requires examining fossils of other seed plants thought to have been closely related to angiosperms. All of those plants were woody, indicating that the common ancestor was probably woody and probably not aquatic. As we’ll see, this conclusion has been supported by recent phylogenetic analyses. Angiosperm Phylogeny Molecular and morphological evidence suggests that extant gymnosperm lineages had diverged from the lineage leading to angiosperms by 305 million years ago. Note that this does not imply that angiosperms originated 305 million years ago, but that the most recent common ancestor of extant gymnosperms and angiosperms lived at...",

On a flower with bilateral sym- metry, an insect pollinator can obtain nectar (a sugary solution secreted by flower glands) only when landing in a certain posi- tion (Figure 30.15). This constraint makes it more likely that pollen is placed on a part of the insect’s body that will come into contact with the stigma of a flower of the same species. Such specificity of pollen transfer reduces gene flow between diverging populations and could lead to increased rates of spe - ciation in plants with bilateral symmetry.

Sponges are filter feeders: They filter out food particles suspended in the surrounding water as they draw it through their body, which in some species resembles a sac perforated with pores. Water is drawn through the pores into a central cavity, the spongocoel, and then flows out of the sponge through a larger opening called the osculum (Figure 33.3).

Many trematodes require an intermediate host in which larvae develop before infecting the final host (usually a vertebrate), where the adult worms live. For example, various trematodes that parasitize humans spend part of their lives in snail hosts (Figure 33.10). Around the world, about 200 million people are infected with trematodes called blood flukes (Schistosoma) and suffer from schistosomiasis, a disease whose symptoms include pain, anemia, and diarrhea. Living within more than one kind of host puts demands on trematodes that free-living animals don’t face. A blood fluke, for instance, must evade the immune systems of both Gastrovascular cavity Eyespots Mouth Ganglia.

Some 360 species of bdelloid rotifers are known, and all of them reproduce by parthenogenesis without any males. Paleontologists have discovered bdelloid rotifers preserved in 35-million-year-old amber, and the mor - phology of these fossils resembles only the female form, with no evidence of males. Molecular clock analyses indicate that bdelloids have been asexual for over 50 million years. While it appears that they do not reproduce sexually, bdelloid roti - fers may be able to generate genetic diversity in other ways. For example, bdelloids can tolerate very high levels of desic- cation. When conditions improve and their cells rehydrate, DNA from other species enters their cells through cracks in the plasma membrane. Recent evidence suggests that this foreign DNA can be incorporated into the bdelloids’ genome, thereby leading to increas...",

Other jawed vertebrates, called acanthodians, emerged at roughly the same time and radiated during the Silurian and Devonian periods (444–359 million years ago).

We begin by discussing plant organs because their structures are most familiar. Vascular Plant Organs: Roots, Stems, and Leaves EVOLUTION The basic morphology, or shape, of vascular plants reflects their evolutionary history as terrestrial organ- isms that inhabit and draw resources from two very different environments—below the ground and above the ground. They must absorb water and minerals from below the ground surface and CO 2 and light from above the ground surface. The ability to acquire these resources efficiently is traceable to the evolution of roots, stems, and leaves as the three basic organs. These organs form a root system and a shoot system, the latter consisting of stems and leaves (Figure 35.2). Vascular plants, with few exceptions, rely on both systems for survival. Roots are almost never photosynthetic; they starve unless photosynthates...",

At maturity, these cells are living and flexible, elongating with the stems and leaves they support—unlike sclerenchyma cells, which we discuss next. Sclerenchyma cells also function as supporting elements in the plant but are much more rigid than collenchyma cells. In scleren- chyma cells, the secondary cell wall, produced after cell elonga- tion has ceased, is thick and contains large amounts of lignin, a relatively indigestible strengthening polymer that accounts for more than a quarter of the dry mass of wood. Lignin is present in all vascular plants but not in bryophytes. Mature sclerenchyma cells cannot elongate, and they occur in regions of the plant that have stopped growing in length.

Because there is a marked contrast between the large cells of the new early wood and the smaller cells of the late wood of the previous growing season, a year’s growth appears as a distinct growth ring in cross sections of most tree trunks and roots. Therefore, researchers can estimate a tree’s age by counting growth rings. Dendrochronology is the sci - ence of analyzing tree growth ring patterns. Growth rings vary in thickness, depending on seasonal growth. Trees grow well in wet and warm years but may grow hardly at all in cold or dry years. Since a thick ring indicates a warm year and a thin ring indicates a cold or dry one, scientists use ring patterns to study climate changes (Figure 35.21).

Moving to uncultivated areas, they observed the same pattern of reduced yields over time. Eventually, they realized that fertilization, the addi - tion of mineral nutrients to the soil, could make soil a renew- able resource that enabled crops to be cultivated season after season at a fixed location. This sedentary agriculture facili- tated a new way of life. Humans began to build permanent dwellings—the first villages. They also stored food for use between harvests, and food surpluses enabled some people to specialize in nonfarming occupations. In short, soil manage - ment, by fertilization and other practices, helped prepare the way for modern societies. Unfortunately, soil misman..."

Changes in cytosolic Ca 2+ levels play an important role in phytochrome signal transduction. The concentration of cytosolic Ca 2+ is generally very low (about 10 -7 M), but phy- tochrome activation leads to the opening of Ca 2+ channels and a transient 100-fold increase in cytosolic Ca 2+ levels. In response to light, phytochrome undergoes a change in shape that leads to the activation of guanylyl cyclase, an enzyme that produces the second messenger cyclic GMP. Both Ca 2+ Reception Signals are first detected by receptors, proteins that undergo changes in shape in response to a specific stimulus. The receptor involved in de-etiolation is a type of phytochrome, a member of a class of photoreceptors that we’ll explore more fully later in the chapter. Unlike most receptors, which are built into the plasma membrane, the type of phytochrome that functions in de-etiolation is lo...",

Some regulated changes occur during a particular stage in life, such as the radical shift in hormone balance that occurs dur - ing puberty. Other regulated changes are cyclic, such as the variation in hormone levels responsible for a woman’s men- strual cycle (see Figure 46.14). In all animals (and plants), certain cyclic alterations in metabolism reflect a circadian rhythm, a set of physiologi - cal changes that occur roughly every 24 hours (Figure 40.9). One way to observe this rhythm is to monitor body tem- perature, which in humans typically undergoes a cyclic rise and fall of more than 0.6°C (1°F) in every 24-hour period. Remarkably, a biological clock maintains this rhythm even when variations in human activity, room temperature, and light levels are minimized (see Figure 40.9a).

Warm blood Cool blood Blood flow Heat transfer Key Arteries carry blood into the goose’s leg and foot. Veins return the blood to the heart. . Figure 40.13 Countercurrent heat exchangers. A countercurrent exchange system traps heat in the body core, thus reducing heat loss from the extremities, particularly when they are immersed in cold water or in contact with ice or snow. In essence, heat in the arterial blood emerging from the body core is transferred directly to the returning venous blood instead of being lost to the environment.

BMR is measured under a “comfortable” temperature range—a range that requires only the minimum generation or shedding of heat. The minimum metabolic rate of ectotherms is determined at a specific temperature because changes in the environ - mental temperature alter body temperature and therefore metabolic rate. The metabolic rate of a fasting, nonstressed body growth and repair, synthesis of storage material such as fat, and production of gametes. The production and use of ATP generate heat, which the animal eventually gives off to its surroundings (Figure 40.18).

Respiration by plants and animals requires taking up oxygen (O 2 ) and releasing carbon dioxide (CO 2 ). In photosynthesis, net exchange occurs in the opposite direction: CO 2 uptake and O 2 release. In both plants and animals, highly convoluted surfaces that increase the area available for gas exchange have evolved, such as the spongy mesophyll of leaves (left) and the alveoli of lungs (right). (See Figure 35.18 and Figure 42.24.) Organisms need to absorb nutrients.

From the liver, blood travels to the heart and then to other tissues and organs. This arrangement serves two major functions. First, it allows the liver to regulate the distribution of nutrients to the rest of the body. Because the liver converts many organic nutrients to different forms for use elsewhere, blood leaving the liver may have a very different nutrient balance than the blood that entered. Second, the arrangement allows the liver to remove toxic substances before they can circulate broadly. The liver is the primary site for detoxifying many organic molecules foreign to the body, such as drugs, and certain metabolic waste products.

Such an arrangement is char - acteristic of certain invertebrates, including cnidarians and flatworms. Animals that lack a simple body plan display an alternative adaptation for efficient exchange: a circulatory system. Such systems move fluid between each cell’s immedi - ate surroundings and the body tissues. As a result, exchange with the environment and exchange with body tissues both occur over very short distances. In most animals, the circulatory system is functionally linked to the exchange of gases with the environment and with body cells. For this reason, we’ll discuss systems for circulation and gas exchange together in this chapter. By considering examples of these systems from a range of species, we’ll explore their common elements as well as their extensive variation.

As the blood continues its passage, its P O 2 steadily increases, but so does that of the water it encounters, since each successive position in the blood’s travel corresponds to an earlier position in the water’s pas - sage over the gills. The result is a partial pressure gradient that favors the diffusion of O 2 from water to blood along the entire length of the capillary. Countercurrent exchange mechanisms are remarkably efficient.

This allows food to go down the esophagus to the stomach (see Figure 41.9). The rest of the time, the glottis is open, enabling breathing. From the larynx, air passes into the trachea.

Long-lived memory cells that are generated in the primary response to antigen A give rise to a heightened secondary response to the same antigen but don’t affect the primary response to another antigen (B). Adaptive immunity defends against infection of body fluids and body cells Having considered how clones of lymphocytes arise, we now explore how these cells help fight infections and minimize damage by pathogens. The defenses provided by B and T lymphocytes can be divided into humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. The humoral immune response pro - tects the blood and lymph (once called body humors, or flu- ids). In this response, antibodies help neutralize or eliminate toxins and pathogens in body fluids. In the cell-mediated immune response, specialized T cells destroy infected host cells. Both humoral and cellular immunity can include a pri - mary and a secondary immune response, with memory cells enabling the secondary response. Helper T Cells: Activating Adaptive Immunity A type of T cell called a helper T cell activates humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. Before this can happen, however, two conditions must be met. First, a foreign mol - ecule must be present that can bind specifically to the antigen receptor of the helper T cell. Second, this antigen must be displayed on the surface of an antigen-presenting cell. An antigen-presenting cell can be a dendritic cell, macrophage, or B cell. Like immune cells, infected cells can display foreign antigens on their surface. What then distinguishes antigen- presenting cells from infected cells? The answer lies in two distinct types, or classes, of MHC molecules. Most body cells have only the class I MHC molecules, but antigen-presenting cells have both class I and class II MHC molecules. The class II molecules provide a molecular signature by which an antigen-presenting cell is recognized. A helper T cell and the antigen-presenting cell display - ing its specific epitope have a complex interaction. The antigen receptors on the surface of the helper T cell bind to the antigen fragment and to the class II MHC molecule displaying that fragment on the antigen-presenting cell (Figure 43.18). At the same time, an accessory protein called CD4 on the helper T cell surface binds to the class II MHC molecule, helping keep the cells joined. As the two cells interact, signals are exchanged in the form of cytokines. For example, the cytokines secreted from a dendritic cell act in combination with the antigen to stimulate the helper T cell, causing it to produce its own set of cytokines. Also, extensive contact between the cell surfaces enables further information exchange. CONCEPT 43.3 decades. (Most effector cells have much shorter life spans, which is why the immune response diminishes after an infection is overcome.)

Even with modern medical care, measles kills on average one out of every 1,000 infected individuals. Active and Passive Immunity Our discussion of adaptive immunity has to this point focused on active immunity, the defenses that arise when a patho- gen infection or immunization prompts an immune response. A different type of immunity results when, for example, the IgG antibodies in the blood of a pregnant female cross the pla - centa to her fetus. This protection is called passive immunity because the antibodies in the recipient (in this case, the fetus) are produced by another individual (the mother).

When two solutions differ in osmolarity, the solution with the higher concentration of solutes is said to be hyperosmotic, and the more dilute solution is said to be hypoosmotic. Water flows by osmo - sis from a hypoosmotic solution to a hyperosmotic one, thus reducing the concentration difference for both solutes and free water (see the diagram on the first page of the chapter). In this chapter, we use the terms isoosmotic, hypoosmotic, and hyperosmotic, which refer specifically to osmolarity, instead of isotonic, hypotonic, and hypertonic. The latter set of terms applies to the response of animal cells—whether they swell or shrink—in solutions of known solute concentrations.

In the last step—excretion—the processed filtrate containing nitrogenous wastes is released from the body as a fluid waste called urine. Survey of Excretory Systems The systems that perform the basic excretory functions outlined in Figure 44.8 vary widely among animal groups. However, they are generally built on a complex network of tubules that provide a large surface area for the exchange of water and sol - utes, including nitrogenous wastes.

Consider, for instance, the water flea (genus Daphnia). A female Daphnia can produce eggs of two types. One type of egg requires fertilization to develop, but the other type does not and develops instead by parthenogenesis. Daphnia reproduce asexually when environ - mental conditions are favorable and sexually during times of environmental stress. As a result, the switch between sexual and asexual reproduction is roughly linked to season. For some asexual animal species, a cycle of reproduc - tive behavior appears to reflect a sexual evolutionary past. In the parthenogenetic lizard species Aspidoscelis uniparens, reproduction is asexual, and all individuals are female. Nevertheless, these lizards have courtship and mating behav - iors very similar to those of sexual species of Aspidoscelis. One member of each mating pair undergoes ovulation, the pro- duction and release of mature eggs. The other female mimics a male (Figure 46.3a). Over the course of the breeding season, the two lizards alternate roles two or three times. An individ- ual adopts female behavior prior to ovulation, when the con- centration of the hormone estradiol is high, and then switches to male-like behavior after ovulation, when the concentration of the hormone progesterone is high (Figure 46.3b).

Clustered at one end of the blastocyst cavity is a group of cells called the inner cell mass, which will develop into the embryo proper. It is the cells of the inner cell mass that are the source of em - bryonic stem cell lines (see Concept 20.3). 2 Implantation of the embryo is initiated by the trophoblast, the outer epithelium of the blastocyst.

Still other mechanisms occur in insects, where gradients of active transcription factors across the body establish both the anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral axes (see Concept 18.4). Once the anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral axes are established, the position of the left-right axis is fixed. Nevertheless, specific molecular mechanisms must establish which side is left and which is right. In vertebrates, there are marked left-right differences in the location of internal organs as well as in the organization and structure of the heart and brain. Recent research has revealed a key role for cilia in setting up this left-right asymmetry, as we will discuss toward the end of this chapter. 1 The polarity of the egg determines the anterior-posterior axis before fertilization. 2 At fertilization, the pigmented cortex slides over the underlying cytoplasm toward the point of sperm nucleus entry.

The Peripheral Nervous System The PNS transmits information to and from the CNS and plays a large role in regulating an animal’s movement and its internal environment (Figure 49.6). Sensory information reaches the CNS along PNS neurons designated as afferent (from the Latin, meaning “to carry toward”). Following information process - ing within the CNS, instructions then travel to muscles, glands, and endocrine cells along PNS neurons designated as efferent (from the Latin, meaning “to carry away”). Note that most nerves are bundles of both afferent and efferent neurons. The PNS has two efferent components: the motor sys - tem and the autonomic nervous system (see Figure 49.8). The neurons of the motor system carry signals to skeletal muscles. Motor control can be voluntary, as when you raise ..."

In embryos, two types of glia play essential roles in the development of the nervous system: radial glia and astrocytes. Radial glia form tracks along which newly formed neurons migrate from the neural tube, the structure that gives rise to the CNS (see Figure 47.14). Later, astrocytes that are adjacent to brain capillaries participate in the formation of the blood-brain barrier, a filtering mechanism that prevents many substances in the blood from entering the CNS. Both radial glia and astro - cytes can also act as stem cells, which undergo unlimited cell divisions to self-renew and to form more specialized cells.

One hypothesis is that the delay in forming connections in the cerebral cortex allows long-term memories to be integrated gradually into the existing store of knowledge and experi - ence, providing a basis for more meaningful associations.

We’ll focus on four basic functions common to sensory pathways: sensory reception, transduction, transmission, and perception. Sensory Reception and Transduction A sensory pathway begins with sensory reception, the detection of a stimulus by specialized sensory cells. Each sensory cell is either a neuron or a cell that regulates a neuron (Figure 50.3). Some sensory cells exist singly; others are col- lected in sensory organs, such as the star-shaped nose of the mole in Figure 50.1. The term sensory receptor describes a sensory cell or organ, as well as the subcellular structure that detects stimuli. Some sensory receptors respond to stimuli from within the body, such as blood pressure and body position. Other recep - tors detect stimuli from outside the body, such as heat, light, pressure, or chemicals. Some of these recept...",

Mechanoreceptors Our senses of hearing and balance, as well as our responses to pressure, touch, stretch, and motion, rely on sensory receptors called mechanoreceptors, which sense physi - cal deformation caused by forms of mechanical energy.

A large- amplitude wave causes more vigorous vibration of the basilar membrane, greater bending of the hairs on hair cells, and more action potentials in the afferent neurons that transmit information to the brain. Pitch is determined by a sound wave’s frequency, the number of vibrations per unit time. The detection of sound wave frequency takes place in the cochlea and relies on the asymmetric structure of that organ. The cochlea can distinguish pitch because the basilar membrane is not uniform along its length: It is relatively narrow and stiff near the oval window and wider and more flexible at the apex at the base of the cochlea. Each region of the basilar membrane is tuned to a different vibration frequency (Figure 50.12b). Furthermore, each region is con- nected by axons to a different location in the cerebral cortex.

For example, most terrestrial mammals are nocturnal, which makes visual displays relatively ineffective. Instead, these species use olfactory and auditory signals, which work as well in the dark as in the light. In contrast, most birds are diurnal (active mainly in daytime) and communicate primarily by visual and auditory signals. Humans are also diurnal and, like birds, use primarily visual and auditory communication. We can thus detect and appreciate the songs and bright colors used by birds to communicate but miss many chemical cues on which other mammals base their behavior. The information content of animal communication var - ies considerably.

Sea stars group together in tide pools, where food is readily available and where they can breed successfully (Figure 53.3a). The aggregation of individuals into groups may also increase the effectiveness of predation or defense; for example, a wolf pack is more likely than a single wolf to subdue a moose, and a flock of birds is more likely than a single bird to warn of a potential attack. A uniform, or evenly spaced, pattern of dispersion may result from direct interactions between individu - als in the population. Some plants secrete chemicals that inhibit the germination and growth of nearby individuals that could compete for resources.

In fact, as ∆t becomes shorter, r ∆t and r become increasingly close to one another in value. Exponential Growth Earlier we described a population whose members all have access to abundant food and can reproduce at their physio- logical capacity. In some cases, a population that experiences such ideal conditions increases in size by a constant propor- tion at each instant in time. When this occurs, the pattern of growth that results is called exponential population growth. The equation for exponential growth is the one presented at the end of the previous section, namely: dN dt =rN The exponential model describes population growth in an idealized, unlimited environment Populations of all species have the potential to expand greatly when resourc..."

Life history traits of an organ- ism are evolutionary outcomes reflected in its development, physiology, and behavior. CONCEPT 53.4 Diversity of Life Histories We’ll focus on three key components of an organism’s life his- tory: when reproduction begins (the age at first reproduction or age at maturity), how often the organism reproduces, and how many offspring are produced per reproductive episode. The fundamental idea that evolution accounts for the diver - sity of life is manifest in the broad range of these life history characteristics in nature. For example, the age at which repro- duction begins varies considerably across species. A typical log- gerhead turtle is about ..."

In one particular type of parasitism, parasitoid insects—usually small wasps—lay eggs on or in living hosts. The larvae then feed on the body of the host, eventually killing it. Many parasites have complex life cycles involving mul - tiple hosts. The blood fluke, which currently infects approxi- mately 200 million people around the world, requires two hosts at different times in its development: humans and freshwater snails (see Figure 33.10). Some parasites change the behavior of their current host in ways that increase the likelihood that the parasite will reach its next host. For instance, crustaceans that are parasitized by acanthocephalan (spiny-headed) worms leave protective cover and move into the open, where they are more likely to be eaten by the birds that are the second host in the worm’s life cycle.

EVOLUTION CONNECTION Explain why adaptations of particular organisms to competition may not necessarily represent instances of character displacement. What would a researcher have to demonstrate about two competing species to make a convincing case for character displacement? 12. SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY An ecologist studying desert plants performed the following experiment. She staked out two identical plots, containing sagebrush plants and small annual wildflowers. She found the same five wildflower species in roughly equal numbers on both plots. She then enclosed one plot with a fence to keep out kangaroo rats, the most common grain-eaters of the area. After two years, four of the wildflower species were no longer present in the fenced plot, but one species had become much more abundant. The control plot had not changed in species diversity. Using the principles of community ecology, propose a hypothesis to explain her results. What additional evidence would support your hypothesis? For selected answers, see Appendix A.

Estuaries and coral reefs also have very high NPP, but their contribution to the global total is smaller because these ecosystems cover only about one-tenth the area covered by tropical rain forests.

Decomposition and Nutrient Cycling Rates Decomposers are heterotrophs that get their energy from detri- tus. Their growth is controlled by the same factors that limit pri- mary production in ecosystems, including temperature, mois- ture, and nutrient availability. Decomposers usually grow faster and decompose material more quickly in warmer ecosystems (Figure 55.12). In tropical rain forests, most organic material decomposes in a few months to a few years, whereas in temper- ate forests, decomposition takes four to six years, on average. The difference is largely the result of the higher temperatures and more abundant precipitation in tropical rain forests. CONCEPT 55.4 ..."

Key processes The main processes driving the water cycle are evaporation of liquid water by solar energy, condensation of water vapor into clouds, and precipitation. Transpiration by terrestrial plants also moves large volumes of water into the atmosphere. Surface and groundwater flow can return water to the oceans, completing the water cycle.

One manifestation of this idea is environmentalist James Lovelock’s Gaia hypothesis, which views Earth itself as a living, homeostatic entity—a kind of superorganism. Are ecosystems capable of evolving? If so, would this be a form of Darwinian evolution? Why or why not? Explain. 11. SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY Using two neighboring ponds in a forest as your study site, design a controlled experiment to measure the effect of falling leaves on net primary production in a pond. 12. WRITE ABOUT A THEME: ENERGY AND MATTER Decomposition typically occurs quickly in moist tropical for- ests. However, waterlogging in the soil of some moist tropical forests results over time in a buildup of organic matter called “peat.” In a short essay (100–150 words), discuss the relation- ship of net primary production, net ecosystem production, and decomposition for such an ecosystem. Are NPP and NEP likely to be positive? What do you think would happen to NEP if a landowner drained the water from a tropical peatland, expos- ing the organic matter to air? 13.

Extinction Risks in Small Populations Small populations are particularly vulnerable to overhar- vesting, habitat loss, and the other threats to biodiversity that you read about in Concept 56.1.

For instance, if the total popu- lation size is 1,000 but only 400 females and 400 males breed, then N e =14*400*4002>1400+4002=800, or 80% of the total population size. Numerous factors can influence N e . As a result, alternative formulas for estimating N e have been developed to account for factors such as age at maturation, genetic relatedness among population members, the effects of gene flow, and population fluctuations. In actual study populations, N e is always some fraction of the total population. Thus, simply determining the total number of individuals in a small population does not necessarily provide a good measure of whether the population is large enough to avoid extinction. Whenever possible, conservation programs attempt to sustain total population sizes that include at least the minimum viable number of reproductively active individuals.

Some biolo- gists are also concerned that the hot-spot strategy places too much emphasis on such a small fraction of Earth’s surface. Climate change makes the task of preserving hot spots even more challenging because the conditions that favor a particular community may not occur there in the future. The biodiversity hot spot in the southwest corner of Australia (see Figure 56.19) holds thousands of species of endemic (unique to that area) plants and many endemic vertebrates. Researchers recently concluded that between 5% and 25% of the plant species they examined may become extinct by 2080 because the plants will be unable to tolerate the increased dryness predicted for this region.

Much of the solar radiation that strikes the planet is emitted toward space as infrared radiation (known informally as “heat radiation”). Although CO 2 , methane, water vapor, and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are transparent to visible light, they inter - cept and absorb much of the infrared radi- ation that Earth emits, radiating most of it back toward Earth. This process, called the greenhouse effect, retains some of the solar heat (Figure 56.30). If it were not for this greenhouse effect, the average air temperature at Earth’s surface would be a frigid -18°C (-0.4°F), and most life as we know it could not exist. As the concentrations of CO 2 and other greenhouse gases rise, more solar heat is retained, thereby increasing the temperature of our planet. So far, Earth has warmed by an average of 0.9°C ..."

Recently, Australia’s Great Barrier Reef had a catastrophic decline: The combined effects of two consecutive marine heat waves (one in 2016, another in 2017) killed so many corals that two-thirds of the reef was severely degraded—so degraded that some scientists worry it may never recover. A key take-home message from these examples is that a given effect of climate change may, in turn, cause a series of other biological changes. The exact nature of such cascading biological effects can be hard to predict, but it is clear that the more our planet warms, the more severely its ecosystems will be affected.
